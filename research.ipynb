       " Document(metadata={'source': 'pdfs2\\\\Pocket Companion to Guyton and Hall 13ed.pdf', 'page': 8}, page_content='vii\\nPreface\\nHuman physiology is the discipline that links the basic \\nsciences with clinical medicine. It is integrative and \\nencompasses the study of molecules and subcellular \\ncomponents, cells, tissues, and organ systems, as well \\nas the feedback systems that coordinate these compo-\\nnents of the body and permit us to function as living \\nbeings. Because human physiology is a rapidly expand-\\ning discipline and covers a broad scope, the vast amount \\nof information that is applicable to the practice of medi-\\ncine can be overwhelming. Therefore, one of our major \\ngoals for writing this Pocket Companion was to distill \\nthis enormous amount of information into a book that \\nwould be small enough to be carried in a coat pocket \\nand used often but still contain most of the basic physi-\\nological principles necessary for the study of medicine.\\nThe Pocket Companion was designed to accompany \\nGuyton and Hall Textbook of Medical Physiology , 13th \\nEdition, not substitute for it. It is intended to serve as a \\nconcise overview of the most important facts and con-\\ncepts from the parent text, presented in a manner that \\nfacilitates rapid comprehension of basic physiological \\nprinciples. Some of the most important features of the \\nPocket Companion are as follows:\\n •  I t was designed to serve as a guide for students who \\nwish to review a large volume of material from the \\nparent text rapidly and efficiently. The headings of \\nthe sections state succinctly the primary concepts \\nin the accompanying paragraphs. Thus, the student \\ncan quickly review many of the main concepts in the \\ntextbook by first studying the paragraph headings.\\n •  The t able of contents matches that of the parent text, \\nand each topic has been cross-referenced with spe -\\ncific page numbers from the parent text. The pocket \\ncompanion has been updated in parallel with the \\nTextbook of Medical Physiology, 13th edition.\\n •  The size of the book has been restricted so it can \\nfit conveniently in a coat pocket as an immediate \\nsource of information.\\nAlthough the Pocket Companion contains the most \\nimportant facts necessary for studying physiology, it \\ndoes not contain the details that enrich the physiological \\nconcepts or the clinical examples of abnormal physiol -\\nogy that are contained in the parent book. We therefore \\nrecommend that the Pocket Companion be used in con-\\njunction with the Textbook of Medical  P hysiology, 13th \\nEdition.'),\n",

In human \\nphysiology, we are concerned with the characteristics of \\nthe human body that allow us to sense our environment, \\nmove about, think and communicate, reproduce, and \\nperform all of the functions that enable us to survive \\nand thrive as living beings.\\nHuman physiology is a broad subject that attempts \\nto explain the specific characteristics and mecha -\\nnisms of the human body that make it a living being. \\nThe subject includes the functions of molecules and \\nsubcellular components; tissues; organs; organ sys-\\ntems, such as the cardiovascular system; and the \\ninteraction and communication among these compo-\\nnents. A distinguishing feature of physiology is that \\nit seeks to integrate the functions of all of the parts \\nof the body to understand the function of the entire \\nhuman body. Life in the human being relies on this \\ntotal function, which is considerably more complex \\nthan the sum of the functions of the individual cells, \\ntissues, and organs.\\nCells Are the Living Units of the Body. Each organ is an \\naggregate of many cells held together by intercellular \\nsupporting structures. The entire body contains \\nabout 100 trillion cells, each of which is adapted \\nto perform special functions. These individual cell \\nfunctions are coordinated by multiple regulatory \\nsystems operating in cells, tissues, organs, and organ \\nsystems.\\nAlthough the many cells of the body differ from \\neach other in their special functions, all of them have \\ncertain basic characteristics. For example, (1) oxygen \\ncombines with breakdown products of fat, carbohy-\\ndrates, or protein to release energy that is required \\nfor function of the cells; (2) most cells have the abil-\\nity to reproduce, and whenever cells are destroyed, \\nthe remaining cells often regenerate new cells until \\nthe appropriate number is restored; and (3) cells are \\nbathed in extracellular fluid, the constituents of which \\nare precisely controlled.\\nCHAPTER 1\\nFunctional Organization of the Human \\nBody and Control of the “Internal \\nEnvironment”'),\n",

Much of our discussion \\nof physiology focuses on mechanisms by which the \\ncells, tissues, and organs contribute to homeostasis.\\nExtracellular Fluid Transport and Mixing \\nSystem—The Blood Circulatory System\\nExtracellular fluid is transported throughout the body \\nin two stages. The first stage is movement of blood \\nthroughout the circulatory system, and the second \\nstage is movement of fluid between the blood capil -\\nlaries and cells. The circulatory system keeps the flu-\\nids of the internal environment continuously mixed \\nby pumping blood through the vascular system. As \\nblood passes through the capillaries, a large portion \\nof its fluid diffuses back and forth into the intersti-\\ntial fluid that lies between the cells, allowing continu-\\nous exchange of substances between the cells and the \\ninterstitial fluid and between the interstitial fluid and \\nthe blood.\\nOrigin of Nutrients in the Extracellular Fluid\\n •  The respiratory system provides oxygen for the body \\nand removes carbon dioxide.\\n •  The gastrointestinal system digests food and facili -\\ntates absorption of various nutrients, including car -\\nbohydrates, fatty acids, and amino acids, into the \\nextracellular fluid.\\n •  The liver changes the chemical composition of \\nmany of the absorbed substances to more us -\\nable forms, and other tissues of the body (e.g., fat \\ncells, kidneys, endocrine glands) help modify the \\nabsorbed substances or store them until they are \\nneeded.\\n •  The musculoskeletal system consists of skeletal mus-\\ncles, bones, tendons, joints, cartilage, and ligaments. \\nWithout this system, the body could not move to the \\nappropriate place to obtain the foods required for \\nnutrition. This system also protects internal organs \\nand supports the body.'),\n",

Even this function can be consid -\\nered a homeostatic function because it generates new \\nbodies in which trillions of additional cells can exist in a \\nwell-regulated internal environment.\\nCONTROL SYSTEMS OF THE BODY (p. 6)\\nThe human body has thousands of control systems \\nthat are essential for homeostasis. For example, genetic \\nsystems operate in all cells to control intracellular and \\nextracellular functions. Other control systems operate \\nwithin the organs or throughout the entire body to con-\\ntrol interactions among the organs.\\nRegulation of oxygen and carbon dioxide concentra-\\ntions in the extracellular fluid is a good example of multi -\\nple control systems that operate together. In this instance, \\nthe respiratory system operates in association with the \\nnervous system. When carbon dioxide concentration in \\nthe blood increases above normal, the respiratory center is \\nexcited, causing the person to breathe rapidly and deeply. \\nThis breathing increases the expiration of carbon dioxide \\nand therefore removes it from the blood and the extracel -\\nlular fluid until the concentration returns to normal.\\nNormal Ranges of Important Extracellular  \\nFluid Constituents\\nTable 1–1 shows some important constituents of extra -\\ncellular fluid along with their normal values, normal \\nranges, and maximum limits that can be endured for \\nshort periods without the occurrence of death. Note the \\nnarrowness of the ranges; levels outside these ranges are \\nusually the cause or the result of illnesses.\\nCharacteristics of Control Systems\\nMost Control Systems of the Body Operate by Negative \\nFeedback . For regulation of carbon dioxide \\nconcentration, as discussed, a high concentration of \\ncarbon dioxide in the extracellular fluid increases \\npulmonary ventilation, which decreases carbon dioxide \\nconcentration, moving it toward normal levels. This \\nmechanism is an example of negative feedback; that is, \\nany stimulus that attempts to change the carbon dioxide \\nconcentration is counteracted by a response that is \\nnegative to the initiating stimulus.'),\n",

The gain is calculated \\naccording to the following formula:\\nGain = Correction/Error\\nSome control systems, such as those that regulate body \\ntemperature, have feedback gains as high as −33, which \\nsimply means that the degree of correction is 33 times \\ngreater than the remaining error.\\nFeed-Forward Control Systems Anticipate Changes . \\nBecause of the many interconnections between control \\nsystems, the total control of a particular body function \\nmay be more complex than can be accounted for \\nby simple negative feedback. For example, some \\nmovements of the body occur so rapidly that there is \\nnot sufficient time for nerve signals to travel from some \\nof the peripheral body parts to the brain and then back \\nto the periphery in time to control the movements. \\nTherefore, the brain uses feed-forward control to cause \\nthe required muscle contractions.

If it has not, the \\nbrain corrects the feed-forward signals it sends to the \\nmuscles the next time the movement is required. This \\nprocess is also called adaptive control, which is, in a \\nsense, delayed negative feedback.\\nPositive Feedback Can Sometimes Cause Vicious Cycles \\nand Death, and Other Times It Can Be Useful . A system that \\nexhibits positive feedback responds to a perturbation \\nwith changes that amplify the perturbation and therefore \\nleads to instability rather than stability. For example, \\nsevere hemorrhage may lower blood pressure to such \\na low level that blood flow to the heart is insufficient \\nto maintain normal cardiac pumping; as a result, blood \\npressure falls even lower, further diminishing blood \\nflow to the heart and causing still more weakness of the \\nheart. Each cycle of this feedback leads to more of the \\nsame, which is a positive feedback or a vicious cycle.\\nIn some cases the body uses positive feedback to its \\nadvantage. An example is the generation of nerve sig -\\nnals. When the nerve fiber membrane is stimulated, the \\nslight leakage of sodium ions into the cell causes open -\\ning of more channels, more sodium entry, more change \\nin membrane potential, and so forth. Therefore, a slight \\nleak of sodium into the cell becomes an explosion of \\nsodium entering the interior of the nerve fiber, which \\ncreates the nerve action potential.\\nSUMMARY—AUTOMATICITY OF THE BODY (p. 10)\\nThe body is a social order of about 100 trillion cells orga-\\nnized into various functional structures, the largest of \\nwhich are called organs. Each functional structure, or \\norgan, helps maintain a constant internal environ -\\nment. As long as homeostasis is maintained, the cells \\nof the body continue to live and function properly. \\nThus, each cell benefits from homeostasis and, in turn, \\neach cell contributes its share toward maintenance of \\nhomeostasis. This reciprocal interplay provides con-\\ntinuous automaticity of the body until one or more \\nfunctional systems lose their ability to contribute their \\nshare of function. When this loss happens, all the cells \\nof the body suffer. Extreme dysfunction leads to death, \\nwhereas moderate dysfunction leads to sickness.'),\n",

The cytoplasm is separated from interstitial \\nfluid by a cell membrane that surrounds the cell. The \\nsubstances that make up the cell are collectively called \\nprotoplasm, which is composed mainly of the following:\\n •  Water constitutes 70 percent to 85 percent of most \\ncells.\\n •  Ions/electrolytes provide inorganic chemicals for cel-\\nlular reactions. Some of the most important ions in \\nthe cell are potassium, magnesium, phosphate, sul -\\nfate, bicarbonate, and small quantities of sodium, \\nchloride, and calcium.\\n •  Proteins normally constitute 10 to 20 percent of the \\ncell mass. They can be divided into two types: struc-\\ntural proteins and globular (functional) proteins, \\nwhich are mainly enzymes.\\n •  Lipids constitute about 2 percent of the total cell \\nmass. Among the most important lipids in the cells \\nare phospholipids, cholesterol, triglycerides, and neu-\\ntral fats. In adipocytes  (fat cells), triglycerides ac -\\ncount for as much as 95 percent of the cell mass and \\nrepresent the body’s main energy storehouse.\\n •  Carbohydrates play a major role in nutrition of the \\ncell. Most human cells do not store large amounts of \\ncarbohydrates, which usually average about 1 percent \\nof the total cell mass but may be as high as 3 percent \\nin muscle cells and 6 percent in liver cells. The small \\namount of carbohydrates in the cells is usually stored in \\nthe form of glycogen, an insoluble polymer of glucose.\\nPHYSICAL STRUCTURE OF THE CELL (p. 12)\\nThe cell (Figure 2–1) is not merely a bag of fluid and \\nchemicals; it also contains highly organized physi-\\ncal structures called organelles. Some of the principal \\norganelles of the cell are the cell membrane, nuclear \\nmembrane, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi appara-\\ntus, mitochondria, lysosomes, and centrioles.\\nThe Cell and Its Organelles Are Surrounded by \\nMembranes Composed of Lipids and Proteins .

Small transport \\nvesicles, also called ER vesicles, continually pinch off  \\nfrom the ER and then fuse with the Golgi apparatus. \\nIn this way, substances entrapped in the ER vesicles are \\ntransported from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. The \\nsubstances are then processed in the Golgi apparatus \\nto form lysosomes, secretory vesicles, and other \\ncytoplasmic components.\\nLysosomes Provide an Intracellular Digestive System . \\nLysosomes, which are found in great numbers in \\nmany cells, are small spherical vesicles surrounded by \\na membrane that contains digestive enzymes. These \\nenzymes allow lysosomes to break down intracellular \\nsubstances in structures, especially damaged cell \\nstructures, food particles that have been ingested by the \\ncell, and unwanted materials such as bacteria.\\nThe membranes surrounding the lysosomes usually \\nprevent the enclosed enzymes from coming in contact \\nwith other substances in the cell and therefore prevent \\ntheir digestive action. When these membranes are dam-\\naged, the enzymes are released and split the organic \\nsubstances with which they come in contact into highly \\ndiffusible substances such as amino acids and glucose.\\nMitochondria Release Energy in the Cell. An adequate \\nsupply of energy must be available to fuel the chemical \\nreactions of the cell. This energy is provided mainly by \\nthe chemical reaction of oxygen with the three types \\nof foods: glucose derived from carbohydrates, fatty \\nacid derived from fats, and amino acids derived from \\nproteins. After entering the cell, foods are split into \\nsmaller molecules that, in turn, enter the mitochondria, \\nwhere other enzymes remove carbon dioxide and \\nhydrogen ions in a process called the citric acid cycle.  \\nAn oxidative enzyme system, which is also in the \\nmitochondria, causes progressive oxidation of hydrogen \\natoms. The end products of mitochondria reactions \\nare water and carbon dioxide. The energy liberated is \\nused by mitochondria to synthesize another substance, \\nadenosine triphosphate (ATP), a highly reactive \\nchemical that can diffuse throughout the cell to release \\nits energy whenever it is needed for the performance of \\ncell functions.'),\n",

Some cells, for example, are \\nrigid and have large numbers of filamentous or tubular \\nstructures, which are composed of fibrillar proteins. A \\nmajor function of these tubular structures is to act as \\na cytoskeleton, providing rigid physical structures for \\ncertain parts of cells. Some of the tubular structures, \\ncalled microtubules, can transport substances from one \\narea of the cell to another.\\nOne of the important functions of many cells is to \\nsecrete special substances, such as digestive enzymes. \\nAlmost all of the substances are formed by the ER-\\nGolgi apparatus system and are released into the cyto-\\nplasm inside storage vesicles called secretory vesicles.  \\nAfter a period of storage in the cell, they are expelled \\nthrough the cell membrane to be used elsewhere in the \\nbody.\\nThe Nucleus Is the Control Center of the Cell and \\nContains Large Amounts of DNA, Also Called Genes (p. 17) . \\nGenes determine the characteristics of the proteins \\nof the cell, including the enzymes of the cytoplasm. \\nThey also control reproduction. Genes first reproduce \\nthemselves through a process of mitosis in which two \\ndaughter cells are formed, each of which receives one of \\nthe two sets of genes.\\nThe nuclear membrane, also called the nuclear enve-\\nlope, separates the nucleus from the cytoplasm. This \\nstructure is composed of two membranes; the outer \\nmembrane is continuous with the ER, and the space \\nbetween the two nuclear membranes is also continuous \\nwith the compartment inside the ER. Both layers of the \\nmembrane are penetrated by several thousand nuclear \\npores, which are almost 100 nanometers in diameter.\\nThe nuclei in most cells contain one or more \\nstructures called nucleoli, which, unlike many of the \\norganelles, do not have a surrounding membrane. The \\nnucleoli contain large amounts of RNA and proteins \\nof the type found in ribosomes. A nucleolus becomes \\nenlarged when the cell is actively synthesizing proteins. \\nRibosomal RNA is stored in the nucleolus and trans-\\nported through the nuclear membrane pores to the \\ncytoplasm, where it is used to produce mature ribo-\\nsomes, which play an important role in the formation \\nof proteins.'),\n",

Very large particles enter \\nthe cell via endocytosis, the principal forms of which are \\npinocytosis and phagocytosis.\\n •  Pinocytosis is the ingestion of small globules of ex-\\ntracellular fluid, forming minute vesicles in the cell \\ncytoplasm. This process is the only method by which \\nlarge molecules, such as proteins, can enter the cells. \\nThese molecules usually attach to specialized recep-\\ntors on the outer surface of the membrane that are \\nconcentrated in small pits called coated pits. On the \\ninside of the cell membrane underneath these pits is \\na latticework of a fibrillar protein called clathrin and \\na contractile filament of actin and myosin. After the \\nprotein molecules bind with the receptors, the mem-\\nbrane invaginates and contractile proteins surround \\nthe pit, causing its borders to close over the attached \\nproteins and form a pinocytotic vesicle.\\n •  Phagocytosis is the ingestion of large particles, such \\nas bacteria, cells, and portions of degenerating tissue. \\nThis ingestion occurs much in the same way as pino-\\ncytosis except that it involves large particles instead \\nof molecules. Only certain cells have the ability to \\nperform phagocytosis, notably tissue macrophages \\nand some white blood cells. Phagocytosis is initiated \\nwhen proteins or large polysaccharides on the sur -\\nface of the particle bind with receptors on the sur -\\nface of the phagocyte. In the case of bacteria, these \\nusually are attached to specific antibodies, and the \\nantibodies in turn attach to the phagocyte receptors, \\ndragging the bacteria along with them. This inter-\\nmediation of antibodies is called opsonization and is \\ndiscussed further in Chapters 34 and 35.\\nPinocytic and Phagocytic Foreign Substances Are \\nDigested in the Cell by the Lysosomes . Almost as soon \\nas pinocytic or phagocytic vesicles appear inside a \\ncell, lysosomes become attached to the vesicles and \\nempty their digestive enzymes into the vesicle. Thus, a \\ndigestive vesicle is formed in which the enzymes begin \\nhydrolyzing the proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and \\nother substances in the vesicle.

Ribosomes synthesize the proteins \\nand extrude many of them through the wall of the ER \\nto the interior of the endoplasmic vesicles and tubules, \\ncalled the endoplasmic matrix.\\nWhen proteins enter the ER, enzymes in the ER wall \\ncause rapid changes, including congregation of carbo -\\nhydrates to form glycoproteins. In addition, the proteins \\nare often cross-linked, folded, and shortened to form \\nmore compact molecules.\\nThe ER also synthesizes lipids, especially phospho -\\nlipid and cholesterol, which are incorporated into the \\nlipid bilayer of the ER. Small ER vesicles, or transport \\nvesicles, continually break off from the smooth reticu -\\nlum. Most of these vesicles migrate rapidly to the Golgi \\napparatus.\\nThe Golgi Apparatus Processes Substances Formed in \\nthe ER. As substances are formed in the ER, especially \\nproteins, they are transported through the reticulum \\ntubules toward the portions of the smooth ER that lie \\nnearest the Golgi apparatus. Small transport vesicles, \\ncomposed of small envelopes of smooth ER, continually \\nbreak away and diffuse to the deepest layer of the Golgi \\napparatus. The transport vesicles instantly fuse with \\nthe Golgi apparatus and empty their contents into the \\nvesicular spaces of the Golgi apparatus. Here, more \\ncarbohydrates are added to the secretions, and the \\nER secretions are compacted. As the secretions pass \\ntoward the outermost layers of the Golgi apparatus, \\nthe compaction and processing continue. Finally, small \\nand large vesicles break away from the Golgi apparatus, \\ncarrying with them the compacted secretory substances. \\nThese substances can then diffuse throughout the cell.\\nIn a highly secretory cell, the vesicles formed by the \\nGolgi apparatus are mainly secretory vesicles, which dif-\\nfuse to the cell membrane, fuse with it, and eventually \\nempty their substances to the exterior via a mechanism \\ncalled exocytosis.

In humans, almost all carbohydrates are converted \\nto glucose by the digestive tract and liver before they \\nreach the cell; similarly, proteins are converted to amino \\nacids, and fats are converted to fatty acids. Inside the cell, \\nthese substances react chemically with oxygen under the \\ninfluence of enzymes that control the rates of reaction \\nand channel the released energy in the proper direction.\\nOxidative Reactions Occur Inside the Mitochondria, and \\nEnergy Released Is Used to Form ATP. ATP is a nucleotide \\ncomposed of the nitrogenous base adenine, the pentose \\nsugar ribose, and three phosphate radicals. The last two \\nphosphate radicals are connected with the remainder of \\nthe molecule by high-energy phosphate bonds, each of \\nwhich contains about 12,000 calories of energy per mole \\nof ATP under the usual conditions of the body. The \\nhigh-energy phosphate bonds are labile so they can be \\nsplit instantly whenever energy is required to promote \\nother cellular reactions.\\nWhen ATP releases its energy, a phosphoric acid \\nradical is split away, and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) \\nis formed. Energy derived from cell nutrients causes the \\nADP and phosphoric acid to recombine to form new \\nATP , with the entire process continuing over and over \\nagain.\\nMost of the ATP Produced in the Cell Is Formed in \\nMitochondria. After entry into the cells, glucose is \\nsubjected to enzymes in the cytoplasm that convert it \\nto pyruvic acid, a process called glycolysis. Less than \\n5 percent of the ATP formed in the cell occurs via \\nglycolysis.\\nPyruvic acid derived from carbohydrates, fatty acids \\nderived from lipids, and amino acids derived from \\nproteins are all eventually converted to the compound \\nacetyl–coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) in the mitochondria \\nmatrix. This substance is then acted on by another \\nseries of enzymes in a sequence of chemical reactions \\ncalled the citric acid cycle, or Krebs cycle.\\nIn the citric acid cycle, acetyl-CoA is split into hydro-\\ngen ions and carbon dioxide.

This reaction releases a \\ntremendous amount of energy, which is used to convert \\nlarge amounts of ADP to ATP . This requires large num-\\nbers of protein enzymes that are integral parts of the \\nmitochondria.\\nThe initial event in ATP formation is removal of an \\nelectron from the hydrogen atom, thereby converting it \\nto a hydrogen ion. The terminal event is movement of \\nthe hydrogen ion through large globular proteins called \\nATP synthetase, which protrude through the mem-\\nbranes of the mitochondrial membranous shelves, which \\nthemselves protrude into the mitochondrial matrix. \\nATP synthetase is an enzyme that uses the energy and \\nmovement of the hydrogen ions to effect the conver -\\nsion of ADP to ATP , and hydrogen ions combine with \\noxygen to form water. The newly formed ATP is trans -\\nported out of the mitochondria to all parts of the cell \\ncytoplasm and nucleoplasm, where it is used to energize \\nthe functions of the cell. This overall process is called \\nthe chemosmotic mechanism of ATP formation.\\nATP Is Used for Many Cellular Functions . ATP promotes \\nthree types of cell function: (1) membrane transport, \\nas occurs with the sodium-potassium pump, which \\ntransports sodium out of the cell and potassium into \\nthe cell; (2) synthesis of chemical compounds throughout \\nthe cell; and (3) mechanical work, as occurs with the \\ncontraction of muscle fibers or with ciliary and ameboid \\nmotion.\\nLocomotion and Ciliary Movements of Cells (p. 24)\\nThe most obvious type of movement in the body is that \\nof the specialized muscle cells in skeletal, cardiac, and \\nsmooth muscle, which constitute almost 50 percent of \\nthe entire body mass. Two other types of movement \\noccur in other cells: ameboid locomotion and ciliary \\nmovement.\\nAmeboid Movement of an Entire Cell in Relation to Its \\nSurroundings. An example of ameboid locomotion is \\nthe movement of white blood cells through tissues. \\nTypically, ameboid locomotion begins with protrusion \\nof a pseudopodium from one end of the cell. This results \\nfrom continual exocytosis, which forms a new cell \\nmembrane at the leading edge of the pseudopodium, \\nand continual endocytosis of the membrane in the mid \\nand rear portions of the cell.\\nTwo other effects are also essential to the forward \\nmovement of the cell. The first effect is attachment '),\n",

This attachment is effected by receptor \\nproteins that line the insides of the exocytotic vesicles.\\nThe second requirement for locomotion is avail -\\nable energy needed to pull the cell body in the direction \\nof the pseudopodium. In the cytoplasm of all cells are \\nmolecules of the protein actin. When these molecules \\npolymerize to form a filamentous network, the net-\\nwork contracts when it binds with another protein, for \\nexample, an actin-binding protein such as myosin. The \\nentire process, which is energized by ATP , takes place \\nin the pseudopodium of a moving cell, in which such \\na network of actin filaments forms inside the growing \\npseudopodium.\\nThe most important factor that usually initiates ame-\\nboid movement is the process called chemotaxis, which \\nresults from the appearance of certain chemical sub -\\nstances in the tissue called chemotactic substances.\\nCiliary Movement Is a Whiplike Movement of Cilia on \\nthe Surfaces of Cells . Ciliary movement occurs in only \\ntwo places in the body: on the inside surfaces of the \\nrespiratory airways and on the inside surfaces of the \\nuterine tubes (i.e., the fallopian tubes of the reproductive \\ntract). In the nasal cavity and lower respiratory airways, \\nthe whiplike motion of the cilia causes a layer of mucus \\nto move toward the pharynx at a rate of about 1 cm/min; \\nin this way, passageways with mucus or particles that \\nbecome entrapped in the mucus are continually cleared. \\nIn the uterine tubes, the cilia cause slow movement of \\nfluid from the ostium of the uterine tube toward the \\nuterine cavity; it is mainly this movement of fluid that \\ntransports the ovum from the ovary to the uterus.\\nThe mechanism of the ciliary movement is not fully \\nunderstood, but at least two factors are necessary: (1) \\navailable ATP and (2) appropriate ionic conditions, \\nincluding appropriate concentrations of magnesium \\nand calcium.'),\n",

Genes are attached in an end-\\non-end manner in long, double-stranded, helical molecules \\nof DNA that are composed of three basic building blocks: \\n(1) phosphoric acid, (2) deoxyribose (a sugar), and (3) four \\nnitrogenous bases: two purines (adenine and guanine) and \\ntwo pyrimidines (thymine and cytosine).\\nThe first stage in DNA formation is the combina -\\ntion of one molecule of phosphoric acid, one molecule \\nof deoxyribose, and one of four bases to form a nucleo-\\ntide. Four nucleotides can therefore be formed, one \\nfrom each of the four bases. Multiple nucleotides are \\nbound together to form two strands of DNA, and the \\ntwo strands are loosely bound to each other.\\nThe backbone of each DNA strand is composed of \\nalternating phosphoric acid and deoxyribose molecules. \\nThe purine and pyrimidine bases are attached to the side \\nof the deoxyribose molecules, and loose bonds between \\nthe purine and pyrimidine bases of the two DNA strands \\nhold them together. The purine base adenine of one strand \\nalways bonds with the pyrimidine base thymine of the \\nother strand, whereas guanine always bonds with cytosine.\\nThe Genetic Code Consists of Triplets of Bases . Each \\ngroup of three successive bases in the DNA strand \\nis called a code word. These code words control the \\nsequence of amino acids in the protein to be formed \\nin the cytoplasm. One code word, for example, might \\nbe composed of a sequence of adenine, thymine, and \\nguanine, whereas the next code word might have a \\nsequence of cytosine, guanine, and thymine.

The replication of DNA is similar to the \\nway RNA is transcribed from DNA, except for a few \\nimportant differences:\\n 1.  B oth strands of the DNA are replicated, not just one \\nof them.\\n 2.  B oth strands of the DNA helix are replicated from \\nend to end rather than small portions of them, as oc-\\ncurs during the transcription of RNA by genes.\\n 3.

The DNA helixes \\nof the nucleus are each packaged as a single chromosome. \\nThe human cell contains 46 chromosomes arranged in \\n23 pairs. In addition to the DNA in the chromosome, \\nthere is a large amount of protein composed mainly \\nof histones, around which small segments of each \\nDNA helix are coiled. During mitosis, the successive \\ncoils are packed against each other, allowing the long \\nDNA molecule to be packaged in a coiled and folded \\narrangement. Replication of the chromosomes in their \\nentirety occurs soon after replication of the DNA \\nhelixes. The two newly formed chromosomes remain \\ntemporarily attached to each other at a point called the \\ncentromere, which is located near their center. These \\nduplicated but still-attached chromosomes are called \\nchromatids.\\nMitosis Is the Process by Which the Cell Splits Into \\nTwo New Daughter Cells . Two pairs of centrioles, which \\nare small structures that lie close to one pole of the \\nnucleus, begin to move apart from each other. This \\nmovement is caused by successive polymerization \\nof protein microtubules growing outward from each \\npair of centrioles. As the tubules grow, they push one \\npair of centrioles toward one pole of the cell and the \\nother toward the opposite pole. At the same time, \\nother microtubules grow radially away from each of \\nthe centriole pairs, forming a spiny star called the aster \\nat each end of the cell. The complex of microtubules \\nextending between the centriole pairs is called the \\nspindle, and the entire set of microtubules plus the pairs \\nof centrioles is called the mitotic apparatus.  Mitosis \\nthen proceeds through several phases.\\n •  Prophase is the beginning of mitosis. While the \\nspindle is forming, the chromosomes of the nucleus \\nbecome condensed into well-defined chromosomes.\\n •  Prometaphase is the stage at which the growing mi-\\ncrotubular spines of the aster puncture and fragment \\nthe nuclear envelope.

The gates are thought to \\nbe molecular extensions of the transport protein, which \\ncan close over the channel opening or be lifted from \\nthe opening by a conformational change in the protein \\nmolecule itself. The opening and closing of gates are \\ncontrolled in two principal ways:\\n •  Voltage gating.

This process is called chemical (or ligand ) \\ngating. One of the most important instances of \\nchemical gating is the effect of acetylcholine on \\nthe “acetylcholine cation channel” of the neuro-\\nmuscular junction.\\nFacilitated Diffusion Is Also Called Carrier-Mediated \\nDiffusion. Molecules transported by facilitated diffusion \\nusually cannot pass through the cell membrane without \\nthe assistance of a specific carrier protein.\\n •  F acilitated diffusion involves the following two \\nsteps: (1) the molecule to be transported enters a \\nblind-ended channel and binds to a specific recep-\\ntor, and (2) a conformational change occurs in the \\ncarrier protein, so the channel now opens to the \\noppo sit e side of the membrane where the molecule \\nis deposited.\\n •  F acilitated diffusion differs from simple diffusion \\nin the following important way. The rate of simple \\ndiffusion increases proportionately with the concen-\\ntration of the diffusing substance. With facilitated \\ndiffusion, the rate of diffusion approaches a maxi-\\nmum value as the concentration of the substance in-\\ncreases. This maximum rate is dictated by the rate at \\nwhich the carrier protein molecule can undergo the \\nconformational change.\\n •  Among t he most important substances that cross \\ncell membranes by facilitated diffusion are glucose \\nand most of the amino acids.\\nFactors That Affect Net Rate of Diffusion (p. 52)\\nSubstances Can Diffuse in Both Directions Through the Cell \\nMembrane. Therefore, what is usually important is the \\nnet rate of diffusion of a substance in one direction. This \\nnet rate is determined by the following factors:\\n •  Permeability. The permeability of a membrane for a \\ngiven substance is expressed as the net rate of diffu-\\nsion of the substance through each unit area of the \\nmembrane for a unit concentration difference be-\\ntween the two sides of the membrane (when there \\nare no electrical or pressure  diff erences).\\n •  Concentration difference. The rate of net diffusion \\nthrough a cell membrane is proportional to the dif-\\nference in concentration of the diffusing substance \\non the two sides of the membrane.\\n •  Electrical potential.

Water is the \\nmost abundant substance to diffuse through the cell \\nmembrane. However, the amount that diffuses in \\neach direction is so precisely balanced under normal \\nconditions that not even the slightest net movement of \\nwater molecules occurs. Therefore, the volume of a cell \\nremains constant. However, a concentration difference \\nfor water can develop across a cell membrane. When \\nthis happens, net movement of water occurs across the \\ncell membrane, causing the cell to either swell or shrink, \\ndepending on the direction of the net movement. The \\npressure difference required to stop osmosis is the \\nosmotic pressure.\\nThe Osmotic Pressure Exerted by Particles in a Solution \\nIs Determined by the Number of Particles per Unit Volume \\nof Fluid and Not by the Mass of the Particles . On average, \\nthe kinetic energy of each molecule or ion that strikes a \\nmembrane is about the same regardless of its molecular \\nsize. Consequently, the factor that determines the \\nosmotic pressure of a solution is the concentration \\nof the solution in terms of number of particles per \\nunit volume but not in terms of the mass of the  \\nsolute.\\nThe Osmole Expresses Concentration in Terms of \\nNumber of Particles. One osmole is 1 gram molecular \\nweight of undissociated solute. Thus, 180 grams of \\nglucose, which is 1 gram molecular weight of glucose, \\nis equal to 1 osmole of glucose because glucose does \\nnot dissociate. A solution that has 1 osmole of solute \\ndissolved in each kilogram of water is said to have an \\nosmolality of 1 osmole per kilogram, and a solution \\nthat has 1/1000 osmole dissolved per kilogram has an \\nosmolality of 1 milliosmole per kilogram.

The pump operates in the following \\nmanner. Three sodium ions bind to a carrier protein on \\nthe inside of the cell, and two potassium ions bind to \\nthe carrier protein on the outside of the cell. The carrier \\nprotein has adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, \\nand the simultaneous binding of sodium and potassium \\nions causes the ATPase function of the protein to \\nbecome activated. The ATPase function then cleaves \\none molecule of ATP , splitting it to form one molecule \\nof adenosine diphosphate and liberating a high-energy \\nphosphate bond of energy. This energy is then believed \\nto cause a conformational change in the protein carrier \\nmolecule, extruding the sodium ions to the outside and \\nthe potassium ions to the inside.'),\n",

When the difference in \\nconcentration of the substance to be transported is \\nsmall, the rate of transport rises approximately in \\nproportion to the increase in concentration. At high \\nconcentrations, the rate of transport is limited by the \\nrates at which the chemical reactions of binding, release, \\nand protein carrier conformational changes can occur.\\nCo-Transport and Counter-Transport Are Two Forms \\nof Secondary Active Transport.

The neuronal cell \\nmembrane is highly permeable to potassium ions \\ncompared with most other ions. Potassium ions \\ntend to diffuse outward because of their high \\nconcentration inside the cell.

This high value of potassium permeability \\nin the Goldman equation yields an internal mem-\\nbrane potential of −86 millivolts, which is close to \\nthe potassium diffusion potential of −94 millivolts.\\n •  Electrogenic nature of the sodium-potassium (Na + -\\nK+ ) pump. The Na + -K +  pump transports three so -\\ndium ions to the outside of the cell for each two \\npotassium ions pumped to the inside, which causes \\na continual loss of positive charges from inside the \\nmembrane. Therefore, the Na+ -K +  pump is electro -\\ngenic because it produces a net deficit of positive \\nions inside the cell, which causes a negative charge \\nof about −4 millivolts inside the cell membrane.\\nNEURON ACTION POTENTIAL (p. 65)\\nNeuronal signals are transmitted by action potentials, \\nwhich are rapid changes in membrane potential. Each \\naction potential begins with a sudden change from the \\nnormal resting negative potential to a positive mem-\\nbrane potential and then ends with an almost equally \\nrapid change back to the resting negative potential.\\nThe successive stages of the action potential are as \\nfollows:\\n •  Resting stage. This is the resting membrane potential \\nbefore the action potential occurs.\\n •  Depolarization stage. At this time, the membrane \\nsuddenly becomes permeable to sodium ions, allow-\\ning tremendous numbers of positively charged so -\\ndium ions to move to the interior of the axon. This \\nmovement of sodium ions causes the membrane \\n potential to rise rapidly in the positive direction.\\n •  Repolarization stage. Within a few ten-thousandths \\nof a second after the membrane becomes highly per-\\nmeable to sodium ions, the voltage-gated sodium \\nchannels begin to close and the voltage-gated potas-\\nsium channels begin to open. Then rapid diffusion \\nof potassium ions to the exterior re-establishes the \\nnormal negative resting membrane potential.\\nVoltage-Gated Sodium and Potassium Channels Are \\nActivated and Inactivated During the Course of an Action \\nPotential. The voltage-gated sodium channel is necessary \\nfor both depolarization and repolarization of the \\nneuronal membrane during an action potential.

This is caused by much greater leakage of \\npotassium ions than sodium ions through the leak \\nchannels.\\n •  At the onset of the action potential, the voltage-gated \\nsodium channels instantaneously become activated \\nand allow up to a 5000-fold increase in sodium per -\\nmeability (also called sodium conductance). The in-\\nactivation process then closes the sodium channels \\nwithin a few fractions of a millisecond. The onset of \\nthe action potential also causes voltage gating of the \\npotassium channels, causing them to begin opening \\nmore slowly.\\n •  At the end of the action potential,  the return of the \\nmembrane potential to the negative state causes the \\npotassium channels to close back to their original \\nstatus but, again, only after a delay.\\nA Positive-Feedback, Vicious Cycle Opens the Sodium \\nChannels. If any event causes the membrane potential \\nto rise from −90 millivolts toward the zero level, the \\nrising voltage itself causes many voltage-gated sodium \\nchannels to begin opening. This action allows rapid \\ninflow of sodium ions, which causes still further rise \\nof the membrane potential, thus opening still more \\nvoltage-gated sodium channels. This process is a \\npositive-feedback vicious cycle that continues until \\nall of the voltage-gated sodium channels have become \\nactivated (opened).\\nAn Action Potential Does Not Occur Until the Threshold \\nPotential Has Been Reached. The threshold potential has \\nbeen reached when the number of sodium ions entering \\nthe nerve fiber becomes greater than the number of \\npotassium ions leaving the fiber.

The concentration of ATP in the muscle \\nfiber is sufficient to maintain full contraction for only \\n1 to 2 seconds. After the ATP is split into adenosine \\ndiphosphate (ADP), the ADP is rephosphorylated to \\nform a new ATP . There are several sources of energy for \\nthis rephosphorylation.\\n •  Phosphocreatine carries a high-energy bond similar \\nto that of ATP but has more free energy. The energy \\nreleased from this bond causes bonding of a new \\ninorganic phosphate ion to ADP to reconstitute the \\nATP . The combined energy of ATP and phosphocre-\\natine is capable of causing maximal muscle contrac -\\ntion for only 5 to 8 seconds.\\n •  The breakdown of glycogen to pyruvic acid and lactic \\nacid liberates energy that is used to convert ADP to \\nATP . The glycolytic reactions can occur in the ab-\\nsence of oxygen. The rate of formation of ATP by the \\nglycolytic process is about 2.5 times as rapid as ATP \\nformation when the cellular foodstuffs react with ox -\\nygen.

The most important char-\\nacteristics of multi-unit smooth muscle fibers are \\nthat each fiber can contract independently of the oth-\\ners and the control is exerted mainly by nerve signals. \\nExamples include the smooth muscle fibers of the \\nciliary muscle of the eye, the iris of the eye, and the \\npiloerector muscles that cause erection of the hairs \\nwhen stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system.\\n •  Single-unit smooth muscle. This type is also called \\nunitary smooth muscle, syncytial smooth muscle, and \\n visceral smooth muscle. A mass of hundreds to mil -\\nlions of muscle fibers contract together as a single \\nunit. The cell membranes of adjacent fibers are con-\\nnected electrically by gap junctions, which permits \\naction potentials to travel from one fiber to the next \\nso that muscle fibers contract together. This type of \\nmuscle is found in the walls of the gastrointestinal \\ntract, bile ducts, ureters, uterus, oviducts, and blood \\nvessels.\\nPhysical Basis for Smooth Muscle Contraction \\n(p. 98)\\nSmooth Muscle Does Not Have the Same Striated \\nArrangement of Actin and Myosin Filaments as Is Found in \\nSkeletal Muscle. \\n •  Actin filaments attach to dense bodies.

Others are attached to the \\ncell membrane and form bonds with dense bodies of \\nadjacent cells, allowing the force of contraction to be \\ntransmitted from one cell to the next. Dense bodies \\ntherefore have similar function to Z disks in skeletal \\nmuscle.\\n •  Myosin filaments are interspersed among actin \\nfilaments. The myosin filaments have a diameter \\nthat is more than twice as large as that of the actin \\nfilaments.\\n •  Contractile units. The individual contractile units \\nconsist of actin filaments radiating from two dense \\nbodies; these filaments overlap a single myosin \\nfilament that is located midway between the dense \\nbodies.\\nComparison of Smooth Muscle Contraction  \\nand Skeletal Muscle Contraction (p. 98)\\nUnlike Skeletal Muscle Contractions, Most Smooth Muscle \\nContractions Are Prolonged Tonic Ones That Sometimes \\nLast Hours or Even Days. Both the physical and chemical \\ncharacteristics of smooth muscle are different than \\nthose of skeletal muscle. Some of the differences are as \\nfollows:\\n •  Slow cycling of the cross-bridges.  The rapidity of \\ncross-bridge cycling in smooth muscle (i.e., the rate \\nof myosin cross-bridge attachment and release with \\nactin) is much slower in smooth muscle than in skel-\\netal muscle.\\n •  Low energy requirement. Only 1/10 to 1/300 as much \\nenergy is required to sustain a contraction in smooth \\nmuscle compared with that of skeletal muscle.\\n •  Slow onset of contraction and relaxation. A typical \\nsmooth muscle begins to contract 50 to 100 milli-\\nseconds after it is excited and has a total contraction \\ntime of 1 to 3 seconds, which is 30 times longer than \\nin skeletal muscle.\\n •  Increased maximum force of contraction. The maxi-\\nmum force of contraction of smooth muscle per unit \\nof muscle cross section is often greater than that of \\nskeletal muscle. This increased force of contraction \\nis postulated to result from the prolonged period of \\nattachment of the myosin cross-bridges to the actin \\nfilaments.\\nSmooth Muscle Can Shorten by a Higher Percentage \\nof Its Length Than Can Skeletal Muscle.

Once smooth muscle has developed full \\ncontraction, the degree of activation of the muscle can \\nusually be reduced to far less than the initial level, yet \\nthe muscle can maintain its full force of contraction. \\nThis is called the latch mechanism. The importance of \\nthe latch mechanism is that it can maintain prolonged \\ntonic contraction in smooth muscle for hours with \\nrelatively little use of energy.\\nRegulation of Contraction by Calcium Ions (p. 99)\\nCalcium Ions Combine With Calmodulin to Cause Activation \\nof Myosin Kinase and Phosphorylation of the Myosin Head . \\nSmooth muscle does not contain troponin but instead \\nhas calmodulin, another calcium-binding regulatory \\nprotein. Although this protein reacts with calcium \\nions, it is different from troponin in the manner in \\nwhich it initiates the contraction; calmodulin does so \\nby activating the myosin cross-bridges. Regulation of \\ncontraction is thus myosin based in smooth muscle, \\nrather than actin based, as it is in skeletal muscle. This \\nactivation and subsequent contraction occur in the \\nfollowing sequence:\\n 1.  T he calcium ions bind with calmodulin; the \\ncalmodulin-calcium complex then joins with and \\nactivates myosin kinase, a phosphorylating enzyme.\\n 2.  One of t he light chains of each myosin head, called \\nthe regulatory chain, becomes phosphorylated in re-\\nsponse to the myosin kinase.\\n 3.  When t he regulatory chain is phosphorylated, the \\nhead has the capability of binding with the actin \\nfilament, causing muscle contraction. When this \\nmyosin light chain is not phosphorylated, the attach-\\nment-detachment cycling of the head with the actin \\nfilament does not occur.\\nMyosin Phosphatase Is Required for Cessation of \\nContraction. When the calcium ion concentration falls \\nbelow a critical level, the aforementioned processes \\nautomatically reverse except for phosphorylation \\nof the myosin head. Reversal of this step requires \\nanother enzyme, myosin phosphatase, which splits the \\nphosphate from the regulatory light chain; the cycling \\nthen stops, and relaxation occurs.'),\n",

These are the sites of transmitter \\nrelease. In most instances, the autonomic nerve fi -\\nbers form so-called diffuse junctions that secrete \\ntheir transmitter substance into the matrix coating \\nof the smooth muscle; the transmitter substance \\nthen diffuses a short distance to the fibers.\\n •  Varicosities on the axon terminals.  The axons that \\ninnervate smooth muscle fibers do not have typical \\nbranching end feet of the type found in the motor \\nend plate on skeletal muscle fibers. Instead, most of \\nthe fine terminal axons have multiple varicosities \\nthat are distributed along their axes.

The onset of this \\ntype of action potential is similar to that of the \\ntypical spike potential. However, repolarization \\nis delayed for several hundred milliseconds. The \\nplateau accounts for the prolonged periods of con-\\ntraction that occur in the ureter, the uterus un -\\nder some conditions, and some types of vascular \\nsmooth muscle.\\nCalcium Ions Are Required for Generating Smooth \\nMuscle Action Potentials. Sodium participates little in \\ngeneration of the action potential in most smooth muscle. \\nInstead, the movement of calcium ions to the interior of \\nthe fiber is mainly responsible for the action potential.\\nSlow-Wave Potentials in Single-Unit Smooth Muscle Can \\nLead to Generation of Action Potentials . Slow waves are \\nslow oscillations in membrane potential. The slow wave \\nitself is not an action potential.\\n •  Cause of slow waves.  Two possible causes of slow \\nwaves are (1) oscillations in sodium pump activity, \\nwhich cause the membrane potential to become \\nmore negative when sodium is pumped rapidly and \\nless negative when sodium is pumped slowly, and (2) \\nthe conductance of the ion channels, which may in -\\ncrease and decrease rhythmically.\\n •  Importance of slow waves.  Action potentials can be \\ninitiated when the potential of the slow wave rises \\nabove threshold (about −35 millivolts). The action \\npotential spreads over the muscle mass, and con-\\ntraction occurs. Slow waves themselves can cause \\nmuscle contractions in gastric smooth muscle.\\nSpontaneous Action Potentials Are Often Generated \\nWhen Visceral (Single-Unit) Smooth Muscle Is Stretched . \\nSpontaneous action potentials result from a combination \\nof the normal slow wave potentials in addition to a \\ndecrease in the negativity of the membrane potential \\ncaused by the stretch itself.

The action potential of skeletal muscle is caused \\nby entry of sodium through fast sodium channels,  \\nwhich remain open for only a few ten thousandths of \\na second. In cardiac muscle, the fast sodium channels \\nalso open at the initiation of the action potential, but \\ncardiac muscle has unique slow calcium channels,  or \\ncalcium-sodium channels.  Calcium and sodium ions \\nflow through the slow channels into the cell after  \\nthe initial spike of the action potential, and they \\nmaintain the plateau. Calcium that enters the cell \\nthrough these channels also promotes cardiac muscle \\ncontraction.\\nAnother Cause of the Plateau of the Action Potential \\nIs a Decrease in the Permeability of Cardiac Muscle Cells \\nto Potassium Ions. The decrease in cardiac potassium \\npermeability also prevents return of the membrane \\npotential in cardiac muscle; this mechanism is not \\npresent in skeletal muscle. When the slow calcium-\\nsodium channels close after 0.2 to 0.3 second, the \\npotassium permeability increases rapidly. Potassium \\nions thus exit the cardiac myocytes, and membrane \\npotential returns to its resting level.\\nDiffusion of Calcium Into the Myofibrils Promotes \\nMuscle Contraction. The action potential spreads into \\neach cardiac muscle fiber along the transverse (T) \\ntubules, causing the longitudinal sarcoplasmic tubules \\nto release calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. \\nThese calcium ions catalyze the chemical reactions that \\npromote the sliding of the actin and myosin filaments \\nalong one another to cause muscle contraction. This \\nmechanism is also present in skeletal muscle.\\nAnother means of calcium entry into the sarco -\\nplasm, however, is unique to cardiac muscle. The T \\ntubules of cardiac muscles have 25 times as great a \\nvolume as those in skeletal muscle volume. These T \\ntubules contain large amounts of calcium that are \\nreleased during the action potential. In addition, the \\nT tubules open directly into the extracellular fluid \\nin cardiac muscle, so their calcium content highly \\ndepends on the extracellular calcium concentration. \\nAt the end of the plateau of the action potential, the \\ninflux of calcium ions into the muscle fiber abruptly \\nstops, and calcium is pumped back into the sarco-\\nplasmic reticulum and T tubules.

The aorta and pulmonary valves are thicker than \\nthe A-V valves and do not have any papillary muscles \\nattached.\\nWork Output of the Heart (p. 117)\\nThe stroke work output  of the ventricles is the output \\nof energy by the heart during each heartbeat. The heart \\nperforms two types of work:\\n •  The volume-pressure work of the heart is the work \\ndone to increase the pressure of the blood; in the \\nleft heart, it equals stroke volume multiplied by the \\ndifference between the left ventricular mean ejec-\\ntion pressure and the left ventricular mean input \\n pressure. The volume-pressure work of the right \\nventricle is only about one sixth that of the left ven-\\ntricle because the ejection pressure of the right ven-\\ntricle is much lower.\\n •  The work to be done to supply kinetic energy to the \\nblood equals MV2 /2, where M is the mass of blood \\nejected and V is the velocity.\\nUsually, only about 1 percent of the work of the heart \\ncreates kinetic energy. However, in persons with a con-\\ndition such as aortic stenosis, the opening of the aortic \\nvalve is very small, and the velocity of blood flow though \\nthe valve is very high. Supplying kinetic energy there -\\nfore can consume as much as 50 percent of the total \\nwork output of the heart.\\nThe Volume-Pressure Diagram of the Left Ventricle \\nDetermines the Cardiac Work Output. The cardiac cycle \\ncan be depicted in a volume-pressure diagram that \\nplots intraventricular pressure as a function of left \\nventricular volume. The phases of the cardiac cycle are \\nas follows:\\n •  Phase I: Period of filling  during which the left ven -\\ntricular volume increases from the end-systolic vol-\\nume to the end-diastolic volume, or from 45 to 115 \\nmilliliters, an increase of 70 milliliters.\\n •  Phase II: Period of isovolumic contraction  during \\nwhich the volume of the ventricle remains at the \\nend-diastolic volume but the intraventricular pres-\\nsure increases to the level of the aortic diastolic pres -\\nsure, or 80 mm Hg.'),\n",

This \\ndiagram and cardiac work are affected by the preload \\nand afterload on the heart. Preload is usually consid -\\nered to be the end-diastolic pressure, and the afterload \\nis considered to be the pressure in the artery exiting the \\nventricle (aorta or pulmonary artery).\\nOxygen Consumption by the Heart Depends on Cardiac \\nWork. Cardiac oxygen consumption mainly depends \\non the pressure-volume type of work. This oxygen \\nconsumption has also been found to be proportional \\nto the tension of the heart multiplied by the time the \\ntension is maintained. According to Laplace’s law, wall \\ntension in the heart is proportional to the pressure times \\nthe diameter of the ventricle. Ventricular wall tension \\ntherefore increases at high systolic pressures or when the \\nheart is dilated.\\nREGULATION OF HEART PUMPING (p. 119)\\nThe Frank-Starling Mechanism Intrinsically Regulates Cardiac \\nPumping Ability. When venous return of blood increases, \\nthe heart muscle stretches more, which makes it pump \\nwith a greater force of contraction. The Frank-Starling \\nmechanism of the heart can be stated in another way: \\nWithin physiological limits, the heart pumps all the blood \\nthat comes to it without allowing excess accumulation of \\nblood in the veins. The extra stretch of the cardiac muscle \\nduring increased venous return, within limits, causes \\nthe actin and myosin filaments to interdigitate at a more \\noptimal length for force generation. In addition, more \\nstretch of the right atrial wall causes a reflex increase in \\nthe heart rate of 10 to 20 percent, which helps the heart \\npump more blood.\\nThe ability of the heart to pump blood can be illus -\\ntrated graphically in several ways. First, stroke work \\noutput can be plotted for each ventricle as a function \\nof its corresponding atrial pressure. Ventricular output '),\n",

Sympathetic stimulation therefore can \\nincrease cardiac output two- to threefold. The heart \\nhas a resting sympathetic tone; therefore, inhibition \\nof the sympathetic system decreases the heart rate  \\nand the force of contraction of the heart, and thus \\ncardiac output decreases. This is explained further in \\nChapter 20.\\nParasympathetic stimulation mainly affects the atria \\nand can decrease the heart rate dramatically and the \\nforce of contraction of the ventricles slightly. The com-\\nbined effect decreases cardiac output by 50 percent or \\nmore.\\nCardiac Contractility Is Affected by Several Factors . \\nAmong the factors that affect cardiac contractility are \\nthe extracellular electrolyte concentrations.

The parts of the internodal pathway are \\nthe anterior internodal pathway, middle internodal \\npathway, and posterior internodal pathway, all of which \\ncarry impulses from the sinoatrial node to the A-V \\nnode. Small bundles of atrial muscle fibers transmit \\nimpulses more rapidly than the normal atrial muscle, \\nand one of these bundles, the anterior interatrial band, \\nconducts impulses from the right atrium to the anterior \\npart of the left atrium.\\nThe A-V Node Delays Impulses From the Atria to the  \\nVentricles. This delay allows the atria to empty their \\ncontents into the ventricles before ventricular contraction \\noccurs. Table 10–1 shows the time of the arrival of \\nimpulses at parts of the conduction system from an \\nimpulse initiated at the sinus node.\\nNote that a delay of 0.09 second occurs between the \\nA-V node and the A-V bundle. The velocity of conduc -\\ntion of this system is only 0.02 to 0.05 m/sec, or one \\ntwelfth that of normal cardiac muscle. The reason for \\nthis slow conduction in the A-V node and bundle is that  \\n(1) the membrane potential is much less negative in the \\nA-V node and bundle than in normal cardiac muscle, and \\n(2) few gap junctions exist between the cells in the A-V \\nnode and bundle, so the resistance to ion flow is great.\\nTransmission of Impulses Through the Purkinje System \\nand Cardiac Muscle Is Rapid . The A-V bundle lies just \\nunder the endocardium and receives the cardiac \\nimpulse first. The A-V bundle then divides into the left \\nand right bundles. The Purkinje fibers normally carry the \\ncardiac impulse into the ventricles. The following are \\ncharacteristics of the Purkinje system:\\n •  The action p otentials travel at a velocity of 1.5 to \\n4.0 m/sec, which is six times the velocity in cardiac \\nmuscle.\\n •  The high p ermeability of the gap junctions at the \\nintercalated discs between the Purkinje fiber cells \\nlikely causes the high velocity of transmission.\\nTable 10–1  Time of Arrival of Impulse\\nSinus node 0.00 sec\\nA-V node 0.03 sec\\nA-V bundle 0.12 sec\\nVentricular septum 0.16 sec'),\n",

The following conditions \\ncause A-V block:\\n •  Ischemia of the A \\xadV node or A \\xadV bundle, which oc -\\ncurs during coronary ischemia if the region of isch-\\nemia includes the A-V node or bundle\\n •  Compression of the A\\xadV bu ndle, which can be caused \\nby scar tissue or calcified portions of the heart\\n •  Inflammation of the A\\xadV no de or bundle, which can oc-\\ncur during myocarditis, diphtheria, or rheumatic fever\\n •  Strong vagal stimulation of the heart\\nThe following types of A-V block may occur:\\n •  First\\xaddeg ree block.  With this condition, the P\\xad R (or P\\xadQ ) \\ninterval increases from a normal value of 0.16 second \\nto about 0.20 second in a heart beating at a normal rate.\\n •  Second\\xaddeg ree block.  When conduction through the \\nA-V junction slows sufficiently for the P\\xad R interval to \\nincrease to 0.25 to 0.45 second, only a portion of the \\nimpulses pass through to the ventricle. Therefore, \\nthe atria beat faster than the ventricles, and “dropped \\nbeats” of the ventricles occur.\\n •  Third\\xaddeg ree block.  This is complete A\\xadV j unction block, \\nwith complete dissociation of the P waves and QRS \\nwaves. Therefore, the ventricles “escape” from the in-\\nfluence of the sinoatrial pacemaker. No dropped beats \\noccur in this condition, but they have a slow ventricu-\\nlar escape rhythm. A condition in which A-V block \\ncomes and goes is called Stokes\\xadA dams syndrome.\\nPREMATURE CONTRACTIONS (p. 158)\\nMost premature contractions (extrasystoles) result from \\nectopic foci that generate abnormal cardiac impulses. \\nThe following conditions cause ectopic foci:\\n •  Local ischemia\\n •  Ir ritation of cardiac muscle as a result of pressure \\nfrom calcified plaque\\n •  T oxic irritation of the A-V node, Purkinje system, or \\nmyocardium by drugs, nicotine, or caffeine\\nEctopic Foci Can Cause Premature Contractions That \\nOriginate in the Atria, A-V Junction, or Ventricle .

The ec -\\ntopic foci originate in the ventricle, and the QRS \\ncomplex is often prolonged because the impulses \\nmust pass through cardiac muscle, which conducts \\nat a much lower rate than the Purkinje system. The \\nQRS voltage increases because one side of the heart \\ndepolarizes ahead of the other, causing a large elec -\\ntrical potential between the depolarized and polarized \\nmuscle. Therefore, PVCs typically exhibit high-voltage, \\nwide-QRS complexes.\\nPAROXYSMAL TACHYCARDIA (p. 160)\\nThe cause of paroxysmal tachycardia is believed to be \\nre-entrant pathways that set up local repeated self–\\nre-excitation. The rapid rhythm of the area causes it to \\nbecome the new pacemaker of the heart. Paroxysmal \\ntachycardia means that the heart rate increases in rapid \\nbursts and then, after a few seconds, minutes, or hours, \\nreturns to normal. Treatment is administration of phar -\\nmacological agents that decrease the sodium or potas -\\nsium permeability of cardiac muscle and thus inhibit the \\nfast rhythmical discharge of the irritable area.\\nTwo basic types of paroxysmal tachycardia occur:\\n •  Atrial paroxysmal tachycardia. When the origin of the \\ntachycardia is in the atrium but is not close to the sino-\\natrial node, an inverted P wave appears that is caused \\nby atrial depolarization in the direction opposite from \\nnormal. When the abnormal rhythm originates in the \\nA-V node, P waves are obscured or inverted; this con -\\ndition is called supraventricular tachycardia.\\n •  Ventricular paroxysmal tachycardia. This type of \\ntachycardia usually does not occur unless significant \\nischemic damage is present in the ventricles. This \\nabnormality often initiates lethal fibrillation.\\nVENTRICULAR FIBRILLATION (p. 161)\\nVentricular fibrillation is the most serious of all cardiac \\narrhythmias. It occurs when an impulse stimulates first \\none portion of the ventricular muscles and then another '),\n",

This stimulation causes \\nmany portions of the ventricles to contract at the same \\ntime while other portions relax. Therefore, impulses \\ntravel around the heart muscle; this phenomenon is also \\nreferred to as circus movements.\\nCircus Movements\\nCircus movements are the basis for ventricular fibril -\\nlation. When an impulse travels throughout an entire \\nnormal ventricle, it dies because all of the ventricular \\nmuscle is in a refractory state. However, three condi-\\ntions allow the impulse to continue around the heart \\nand start circus movements:\\n •  Increased pathway around the ventricle. By the time \\nthe impulses return to an originally stimulated mus-\\ncle, it is no longer in a refractory state, and the im -\\npulse then continues to travel around the heart. This \\nis especially likely to occur in hearts that are dilated \\nor have valvular disease or other conditions with a \\nlong pathway of conduction.\\n •  Decreased velocity of conduction. By the time \\nthe slower impulse travels around the heart, the \\nmuscle is no longer refractory to a new impulse \\nand is stimulated again. This phenomenon often \\noccurs in the Purkinje system during ischemia of \\nthe cardiac muscle or with high blood potassium \\nconcentration.\\n •  Shortened refractory period of the muscles. This condi-\\ntion allows repeated stimulation as the impulse trav-\\nels around the heart and occurs after administration \\nof epinephrine or repetitive electrical stimulation.\\nDefibrillation of the heart causes essentially all \\nparts of the ventricles to become refractory. Clinically, \\nthe heart can be defibrillated by applying high-voltage \\ndirect current through the chest with electrodes placed \\non either side of the heart.\\nATRIAL FIBRILLATION (p. 164)\\nBecause the atria and ventricles are insulated from one \\nanother, ventricular fibrillation can occur without atrial \\nfibrillation, and atrial fibrillation can occur without ven-\\ntricular fibrillation. The causes of atrial fibrillation are \\nidentical to those of ventricular fibrillation. A frequent \\ncause of atrial fibrillation is an enlarged atrium resulting \\nfrom heart valve lesions. The atria do not pump if they \\nare fibrillating, and the efficiency of ventricular pumping \\ndecreases 20 percent to 30 percent. A person can live '),\n",

The functional parts of the circulation are:\\n •  The arteries, which transport blood under high pres-\\nsure to the tissues and have strong vascular walls and \\nrapid blood flow.\\n •  The arterioles, which are the last small branches \\nof the arterial system and act as control conduits \\nthrough which blood is released into the capillaries. \\nThese vessels have strong muscular walls that can be \\nconstricted or dilated, giving them the capability of \\nmarkedly altering blood flow to the capillaries in re -\\nsponse to changing tissue needs.\\n •  The capillaries, which exchange fluids, nutrients, \\nand other substances between the blood and the in -\\nterstitial fluid. They have thin walls and are highly \\npermeable to small molecules.\\n •  The venules, which collect blood from the  c apillaries \\nand gradually coalesce into progressively larger veins.\\n •  The veins, which function as conduits to transport \\nblood from the tissues back to the heart; veins also \\nserve as reservoirs for blood. They have thin walls, \\nlow pressure, and rapid blood flow.\\nThe Circulation Is a Complete Circuit . Contraction of \\nthe left heart propels blood into the systemic circulation \\nthrough the aorta, which empties into smaller arteries, \\narterioles, and eventually capillaries. Because the blood \\nvessels are distensible, each contraction of the heart \\ndistends the vessels; during relaxation of the heart, the \\nvessels recoil, thereby continuing flow to the tissues, \\neven between heartbeats. Blood leaving the tissues \\nenters the venules and then flows into increasingly \\nlarger veins, which carry the blood to the right heart.\\nCHAPTER 14\\nOverview of the Circulation; Biophysics  \\nof Pressure, Flow, and Resistance'),\n",

From the pulmo-\\nnary capillaries, blood flows into venules and large \\nveins and empties into the left atrium and left ventricle \\nbefore it is again pumped into the systemic circulation.\\nA Change in Flow in Any Part of the Circulation \\nTransiently Alters Flow in Other Parts. An example is strong \\nconstriction of the arteries in the systemic circulation, \\nwhich can transiently reduce the total cardiac output, in \\nwhich case blood flow to the lungs decreases equally as \\nmuch as flow through the systemic circulation.\\nIn addition, sudden constriction of a blood vessel \\nmust always be accompanied by opposite dilation of \\nanother part of the circulation because blood volume \\ncannot change rapidly and blood is not compressible. \\nFor instance, strong constriction of the veins in the sys-\\ntemic circulation displaces blood into the heart, dilating \\nthe heart and causing it to pump with increased force; \\nthis is one of the mechanisms by which cardiac output is \\nregulated. With prolonged constriction or dilation of a \\nportion of the circulation, changes in total blood volume \\ncan occur through exchange with the interstitial fluid or \\nbecause of changes in fluid excretion by the kidneys.\\nMost of the Blood Volume Is Distributed in the Veins of \\nthe Systemic Circulation . About 84 percent of the total \\nblood volume is in the systemic circulation, with 64 \\npercent in the veins, 13 percent in the arteries, and 7 \\npercent in the systemic arterioles and capillaries.

Because approximately the \\nsame volume of blood flows through each segment of  \\nthe circulation, vessels with a large cross-sectional area, \\nsuch as the capillaries, have slower blood flow velocity.

In \\na healthy adult, systolic pressure is approximately 120 \\nmm Hg, and diastolic pressure is 80 mm Hg. This \\nblood pressure is usually written as 120/80 mm Hg. \\nThe difference between systolic and diastolic pressure \\nis called the pulse pressure (120 − 80 = 40 mm Hg). \\nAs blood flows through the systemic circulation, its \\npressure falls progressively to approximately 0 mm Hg \\nby the time it reaches the termination of the venae cavae \\nin the right atrium of the heart.\\nPressure in the systemic capillaries varies from as \\nhigh as 35 mm Hg near the arteriolar ends to as low as \\n10 mm Hg near the venous ends, but the average func-\\ntional capillary pressure is about 17 mm Hg.

However, three basic principles underlie \\nthe major functions of the circulatory system:\\n •  The blood flow to each tissue of the body is controlled \\naccording to the tissue’s needs. Tissues need more \\nblood flow when they are active than when they \\nare at rest—occasionally as much as 20 times more \\nblood flow. The microvessels of each tissue continu-\\nously monitor the tissue needs and control the blood \\nflow at the level required for the tissue activity.

After blood flows through a tissue, \\nit immediately returns by way of the veins to the \\nheart. The heart responds automatically to the in-\\nflow of blood by pumping almost all of it immedi-\\nately back into the arteries. In this sense, the heart \\nresponds to the demands of the tissues, although \\nit often needs help in the form of nervous stimu-\\nlation to make it pump the required amounts of \\nblood flow.\\n •  The arterial pressure is usually controlled indepen -\\ndently of local blood flow or cardiac output control.  \\nThe circulatory system is provided with an extensive \\nsystem for controlling arterial pressure. If arterial \\npressure falls below normal, a barrage of nervous \\nreflexes elicits a series of circulatory changes that \\nelevate the pressure back toward normal, includ -\\ning increased force of heart pumping, contraction \\nof large venous reservoirs to provide more blood to \\nthe heart, and constriction of most of the arterioles \\nthroughout the body. Over more prolonged peri-\\nods, the kidneys play additional roles by secreting \\npressure-controlling hormones and by regulating \\nblood volume.\\nINTERRELATIONSHIPS OF PRESSURE, FLOW,  \\nAND RESISTANCE (p. 171)\\nBlood Flow Through a Vessel Is Determined by the Pressure \\nGradient and Vascular Resistance. The flow of blood \\nthrough a vessel can be calculated by the formula \\nF =Δ P/R, where F is blood flow, ΔP is the pressure \\ndifference between the two ends of the vessel, and R \\nis the vascular resistance. Note that it is the difference \\nin pressure between the two ends of the vessel that \\nprovides the driving force for flow, not the absolute \\npressure in the vessel. For example, if the pressure at \\nboth ends of the vessel were 100 mm Hg, there would \\nbe no flow despite the presence of high pressure.\\nBecause of the extreme importance of the relation-\\nship among pressure, flow, and resistance, the reader \\nshould become familiar with the other two algebraic \\nforms of this relationship: ΔP = F × R and R=Δ P/F.  \\nBlood pressure is usually expressed in millimeters \\nof mercury (mm Hg), and blood flow is expressed in \\nmilliliters per minute (ml/min); vascular resistance \\nis expressed as mm Hg/ml per minute.

Therefore, the total pulmonary vascular \\nresistance is much lower than the systemic vascular \\nresistance.\\nVessel Diameter Has a Marked Effect on Resistance to \\nBlood Flow—Poiseuille’s Law.

Because vascular resistance is \\ninversely related to the fourth power of the radius, even \\nsmall changes in radius can cause very large changes \\nin resistance. For example, if the radius of a blood \\nvessel increases from one to two (two times normal), \\nresistance decreases to 1/16 of normal (½ 4) and flow \\nincreases to 16 times normal if the pressure gradient \\nremains unchanged. Small vessels in the circulation \\nhave the greatest amount of resistance, whereas large \\nvessels have little resistance to blood flow.\\nFor a parallel arrangement of blood vessels, as occurs \\nin the systemic circulation in which different organs are \\neach supplied by an artery that branches into multiple \\nvessels, the total resistance can be expressed as\\n1\\nRtotal\\n1\\nR1\\n1\\nR2RR nR... 1\\nwhere R1, R2, and Rn are the resistances of each of the \\nvarious vascular beds in the circulation.

Because blood \\nfrom systemic veins flows into the right atrium, anything \\nthat affects the right atrial pressure usually affects \\nvenous pressure everywhere in the body. Right atrial \\npressure is regulated by a balance between the ability of \\nthe heart to pump blood out of the right atrium and a \\ntendency of blood to flow from the peripheral vessels back \\nto the right atrium.\\nThe normal right atrial pressure is about 0 mm Hg, \\nbut it can rise to as high as 20 to 30 mm Hg under \\nabnormal conditions, such as with serious heart failure \\nor after a massive transfusion.\\nIncreased Venous Resistance Can Increase the \\nPeripheral Venous Pressure. When large veins are \\ndistended, they offer little resistance to blood flow. \\nMany of the large veins entering the thorax are \\ncompressed by the surrounding tissues, however, so \\nthey are at least partially collapsed or collapsed to an \\novoid state. For these reasons, large veins usually offer \\nsignificant resistance to blood flow, and the pressure in \\nthe peripheral veins is usually 4 to 7 mm Hg higher than \\nthe right atrial pressure. Partial obstruction of a large \\nvein markedly increases the peripheral venous pressure \\ndistal to the obstruction.\\nIncreased Right Atrial Pressure Increases Peripheral \\nVenous Pressure. When the right atrial pressure rises above \\nits normal level of 0 mm Hg, blood begins to back up in \\nlarge veins and open them up. Pressures in the peripheral \\nveins do not rise until the collapsed points between the \\nperipheral veins and the large central veins have opened, \\nwhich usually occurs at a right atrial pressure of about \\n4 to 6 mm Hg. When the right atrial pressure rises \\nfurther, as occurs during severe heart failure, it causes a \\ncorresponding rise in peripheral venous pressure.\\nGravitational Pressure Affects Venous Pressure . The \\npressure at the surface of a body of water exposed to air \\nis equal to the atmospheric pressure, but the pressure \\nrises 1 mm Hg for each 13.6 mm Hg distance below the \\nsurface. This pressure results from the weight of the water \\nand therefore is called gravitational hydrostatic pressure.\\nGravitational hydrostatic pressure also occurs in the \\nvascular system because of the weight of the blood in \\nthe vessels. In an adult who is standing absolutely still, \\npressure in the veins of the feet is approximately +90 \\nmm Hg because of the hydrostatic weight of the blood \\nin the veins between the heart and the feet.'),\n",

Were it not for the valves of the veins, \\nthe gravitational pressure effect would cause venous \\npressure in the feet to always be about +90 mm Hg in \\na standing adult. Each time one tightens the muscles \\nand moves the legs, however, this compresses the veins \\neither in the muscles or adjacent to them and squeezes \\nthe blood out of the veins.\\nThe valves in the veins are arranged so the direc -\\ntion of blood flow can only be toward the heart. Conse -\\nquently, each time a person moves the legs or tenses the \\nmuscles, a certain amount of blood is propelled toward \\nthe heart, and the pressure in the veins is lowered. This \\npumping system is known as the “venous pump” or \\n“muscle pump, ” and it keeps the venous pressure in the \\nfeet of a walking adult near 25 mm Hg.\\nIf a person stands perfectly still, however, the venous \\npump does not work, and venous pressure quickly \\nrises to the full hydrostatic value of 90 mm Hg. If the \\nvalves of the venous system become incompetent or are \\ndestroyed, the effectiveness of the venous pump is also \\ndecreased. When valve incompetence develops, greater \\npressure in the veins of the legs may further increase \\nthe size of the veins and finally destroy the function \\nof the valves entirely. When the function of the valves \\nis destroyed entirely, varicose veins develop, and the \\nvenous and capillary pressures increase to high levels, \\ncausing leakage of fluid from the capillaries and edema \\nin the legs when standing.\\nThe Veins Function as Blood Reservoirs . More than 60 \\npercent of the blood in the circulatory system is usually \\ncontained in the veins. For this reason and because the \\nveins are so compliant, the venous system can serve as \\na blood reservoir for the circulation. For example, when \\nblood is lost from the body, activation of the sympathetic \\nnervous system causes the veins to constrict, which \\ntakes up much of the “slack” of the circulatory system \\ncaused by the lost blood.\\nCertain portions of the circulatory system are so \\ncompliant that they are especially important as blood \\nreservoirs. These areas include (1) the spleen, which can \\nsometimes decrease in size to release as much as 100 \\nmilliliters of blood into the reservoir of the circulation; \\n(2) the liver, the sinuses of which can release several \\nhundred milliliters of blood into the remainder of the \\ncirculation; (3) the large abdominal veins,  which can \\ncontribute as much as 300 milliliters; and (4) the venous \\nplexus underneath the skin,  which can contribute sev -\\neral hundred milliliters.'),\n",

Lipid-soluble substances \\nsuch as oxygen and carbon dioxide can diffuse directly \\nthrough the cell membranes without having to go through \\nthe pores. Water-soluble substances, such as glucose and \\nelectrolytes, diffuse only through intercellular pores in the \\ncapillary membrane. The rate of diffusion for most solutes \\nis so great that cells as far as 50 micrometers away from \\nthe capillaries can receive adequate quantities of nutrients.\\nThe following primary factors affect the rate of diffu-\\nsion across the capillary walls:\\n 1.  The pore size in the capillary. In most capillaries, the \\npore size is 6 to 7 nanometers. The pores of some \\ncapillary membranes, such as the liver capillary sinu-\\nsoids, are much larger and are therefore much more \\nhighly permeable to substances dissolved in plasma.\\n 2.  The molecular size of the diffusing substance. Water \\nand most electrolytes, such as sodium and chlo-\\nride, have a molecular size that is smaller than the \\npore size, allowing rapid diffusion across the capil-\\nlary wall. Plasma proteins, however, have a molecu-\\nlar size that is slightly greater than the width of the \\npores, restricting their diffusion.\\n 3.  The concentration difference of the substance between \\nthe two sides of the membrane. The greater the differ-\\nence between the concentrations of a substance on \\nthe two sides of the capillary membrane, the greater \\nis the rate of diffusion in one direction through the \\nmembrane. The concentration of oxygen in blood is \\nnormally higher than in interstitial fluid, allowing \\nlarge quantities of oxygen to move from the blood \\ntoward the tissues.

The \\nfluid in these spaces is the interstitial fluid. The intersti-\\ntium has two major types of solid structures: (1) collagen \\nfiber bundles and (2) proteoglycan filaments. The colla -\\ngen provides most of the tensional strength of the tissues, \\nwhereas the proteoglycan filaments, composed mainly \\nof hyaluronic acid, are very thin and form a filler of fine \\nreticular filaments, often described as a “brush pile. ”'),\n",

As dis -\\ncussed previously, capillary walls are highly permeable \\nto water and most plasma solutes, except plasma pro-\\nteins; therefore, hydrostatic pressure differences across \\nthe capillary wall push protein-free plasma (ultrafil-\\ntrate) through the capillary wall into the interstitium. \\nIn contrast, osmotic pressure caused by the plasma \\nproteins (called colloid osmotic pressure) tends to cause \\nfluid movement by osmosis from the interstitial spaces \\ninto the blood. Interstitial fluid hydrostatic and colloid \\nosmotic pressures also influence fluid filtration across \\nthe capillary wall.\\nThe rate at which ultrafiltration occurs across the \\ncapillary depends on the difference in hydrostatic and \\ncolloid osmotic pressures of the capillary and intersti-\\ntial fluid.

When \\nblood is flowing through many capillaries, the pressure \\naverages 30 to 40 mm Hg on the arterial ends and 10 to \\n15 mm Hg on the venous ends, or about 25 mm Hg in \\nthe middle. When the capillaries are closed, the pressure \\nin the capillaries beyond the closure is about equal to the \\npressure at the venous ends of the capillaries (10 mm \\nHg). When averaged over a period of time, including \\nthe periods of opening and closure of the capillaries, \\nthe functional mean capillary pressure  is closer to the \\npressure in the venous ends of the capillaries than to \\nthe pressure in the arteriole ends.

One of the basic reasons for \\nthis negative pressure is the lymphatic pumping system \\n(discussed later).

Long-term control occurs \\nover a period of days, weeks, or even months and, in \\ngeneral, provides even better control of flow in pro-\\nportion to the needs of the tissues.

In the absence of an adequate supply \\nof oxygen and nutrients (e.g., as a result of increased \\ntissue metabolism), the arterioles, metarterioles, \\nand precapillary sphincters relax, thereby decreasing \\nvascular resistance and allowing more flow to the \\ntissues. The relaxation of precapillary sphincters \\nallows flow to occur more often in capillaries that are \\nclosed because of periodic contraction of precapillary \\nsphincters (vasomotion).\\nAccumulation of Vasodilator Metabolites Increases \\nTissue Blood Flow. The greater the rate of metabolism in \\nthe tissue, the greater the rate of production of tissue \\nmetabolites, such as adenosine, adenosine phosphate \\ncompounds, carbon dioxide, lactic acid, potassium \\nions, and hydrogen ions. Each of these substances has \\nbeen suggested to act as a vasodilator that contributes \\nto increased blood flow associated with stimulation of \\ntissue metabolism.\\nLack of Other Nutrients May Cause Vasodilation . \\nDeficiency of glucose, amino acids, or fatty acids \\nmay contribute to local vasodilation, although this \\nhas not been proven. Vasodilation occurs in patients \\nwith beriberi, who usually have a deficiency of the \\nvitamin B substances thiamine, niacin, and riboflavin. \\nBecause these vitamins are all involved in the oxidative \\nphosphorylation mechanism for generating adenosine \\ntriphosphate, a deficiency of these vitamins may lead \\nto diminished ability of the smooth muscle to contract, \\nthereby causing local vasodilation.\\nSpecial Examples of Acute “Metabolic” Control \\nof Local Blood Flow (p. 206)\\n“Reactive Hyperemia” Occurs After the Blood Supply to a \\nTissue Is Blocked for a Short Time .

The increased flow continues for a few seconds \\nor much longer if the flow has been stopped for 1 hour \\nor longer. This phenomenon is called reactive hyperemia \\nand appears to be a manifestation of local “metabolic” \\nblood flow regulation mechanisms. After vascular \\nocclusion, tissue vasodilator metabolites accumulate in \\nthe tissues and oxygen deficiency develops. The extra \\nblood flow during reactive hyperemia lasts long enough '),\n",

When a tissue becomes highly active, \\nsuch as muscle during exercise or even the brain during \\nincreased mental activity, blood flow to the tissue \\nincreases. Again, this appears to be related to increases \\nin local tissue metabolism that cause accumulation of \\nvasodilator substances and possibly a slight oxygen \\ndeficit. The dilation of local blood vessels helps the tissue \\nreceive the additional nutrients required to sustain its \\nnew level of function.\\nTissue Blood Flow Is “Autoregulated” During Changes in \\nArterial Pressure. In any tissue of the body, acute increases \\nin arterial pressure cause an immediate increase in \\nblood flow. Within less than 1 minute, however, the \\nblood flow in many tissues returns toward the normal \\nlevel even though the arterial pressure remains elevated. \\nThis is called autoregulation of blood flow.\\n •  The metabolic theory of autoregulation suggests that \\nwhen arterial pressure rises and blood flow becomes \\ntoo great, the excess provides surplus oxygen and \\nnutrients to the tissues, causing the blood vessels to \\nconstrict and the flow to return toward normal de-\\nspite the increased arterial pressure.\\n •  The myogenic theory of autoregulation suggests \\nthat sudden stretch of small blood vessels causes \\nthe smooth muscles in the vessel walls to contract \\nautomatically. This intrinsic property of smooth \\nmuscles allows them to resist excessive stretching. \\nConversely, at low pressures the degree of stretch \\nof the vessel is less and the smooth muscle relaxes, \\ndecreasing vascular resistance and allowing flow to \\nbe maintained relatively constant despite the lower \\nblood pressure.\\nThe relative importance of these two mechanisms \\nfor autoregulation of blood flow is still debated by physi -\\nologists. It seems likely that both mechanisms contrib -\\nute to maintaining a relatively stable blood flow during \\nvariations in arterial pressure.\\nAdditional Mechanisms for Blood Flow Control in Specific \\nTissues. The general mechanisms for local blood flow \\ncontrol discussed thus far are present in most tissues of \\nthe body; however, special mechanisms also exist that \\ncontrol blood flow in certain areas. These mechanisms \\nare discussed in relation to specific organs, but the \\nfollowing three mechanisms are notable:\\n •  In the kidneys, blood flow is regulated, in part, via \\na mechanism called tubuloglomerular feedback, in '),\n",

The macula \\ndensa is located where the tubule abuts the afferent \\nand efferent arterioles at the juxtaglomerular appa-\\nratus. When too much fluid filters from the blood \\nthrough the glomerulus into the tubular system, \\nfeedback signals from the macula densa cause con -\\nstriction of the afferent arterioles, thereby reducing \\nrenal blood flow and returning the glomerular filtra-\\ntion rate toward normal (see Chapter 26  for further \\ndiscussion).\\n •  In the brain, the concentrations of carbon dioxide \\nand hydrogen play prominent roles in local blood \\nflow control. An increase in either carbon dioxide or \\nhydrogen dilates the cerebral blood vessels, which al-\\nlows rapid washout of the excess carbon dioxide and \\nhydrogen ions.\\n •  In the skin, blood flow control is closely linked to body \\ntemperature and is controlled largely by the central \\nnervous system through the sympathetic nerves, as \\ndiscussed in Chapter 74. When humans are exposed \\nto heating of the body, skin blood flow may increase \\nmanyfold, to as high as 7 to 8 L/min for the entire \\nbody. When body temperature is reduced, skin \\nblood flow decreases, falling to barely above zero at \\nvery low temperatures.\\nEndothelial Cells Control Blood Flow By Releasing \\nthe Vasodilator Nitric Oxide. The local mechanisms for \\ncontrolling tissue blood flow act mainly on the very \\nsmall microvessels of the tissues because local feedback \\nby vasodilator substances or oxygen deficiency can \\nreach only these vessels, not the larger arteries upstream. \\nWhen blood flow through the microvascular portion \\nof the circulation increases, however, the endothelial \\ncells lining the larger vessels release a vasodilator \\nsubstance called endothelium-derived relaxing factor,  \\nwhich appears to be mainly nitric oxide. This release of \\nnitric oxide is caused, in part, by increased shear stress \\non the endothelial walls, which occurs as blood flows \\nmore rapidly through the larger vessels. The release \\nof nitric oxide then relaxes the larger vessels, causing \\nthem to dilate. Without the dilation of larger vessels, the \\neffectiveness of local blood flow would be compromised \\nbecause a significant part of the resistance in blood flow \\nis in the upstream arterioles and small arteries.\\nEndothelial Cells Also Release Vasoconstrictor \\nSubstances. The most important of these substances is \\nendothelin, a peptide that is released when blood vessels \\nare injured. The usual stimulus for release is damage to '),\n",

After severe blood vessel damage, release \\nof local endothelin and subsequent vasoconstriction \\nhelp prevent extensive bleeding from arteries.\\nLong-Term Blood Flow Regulation (p. 209)\\nMost of the mechanisms discussed thus far act within \\na few seconds to a few minutes after local tissue con-\\nditions have changed. Even with full function of these \\nacute mechanisms, blood flow usually is adjusted only \\nabout three fourths of the way back to the exact require-\\nments of the tissues. Over a period of hours, days, and \\nweeks, long-term local blood flow regulation develops \\nthat helps adjust the blood flow so it matches precisely \\nthe metabolic needs of the tissues.\\nChanges in Tissue Vascularity Contribute to Long-Term \\nRegulation of Blood Flow . If metabolism of a tissue is \\nincreased for prolonged periods, the physical size of the \\nvessels in the tissue increases; under some conditions, \\nthe number of blood vessels also increases. One of the \\nmajor factors that stimulates this increased vascularity \\nis low oxygen concentration in the tissues. Animals \\nthat live at high altitudes, for instance, have increased \\nvascularity. Likewise, fetal chicks hatched at low \\noxygen levels have up to twice as much vascularity as \\nnormal fetal chicks. This growth of new vessels is called \\nangiogenesis.\\nAngiogenesis occurs mainly in response to the pres -\\nence of angiogenic factors released from (1) ischemic \\ntissues, (2) tissues that are growing rapidly, and (3) tis-\\nsues that have excessively high metabolic rates.\\nMany Angiogenic Factors Are Small Peptides. Four of \\nthe best characterized angiogenic factors are vascular \\nendothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth \\nfactor (FGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), \\nand angiogenin, each of which has been isolated from \\ntumors or other tissues that are rapidly growing or have \\nan inadequate blood supply.\\nAngiogenesis begins with new vessels sprouting \\nfrom small venules or, occasionally, capillaries. The \\nbasement membrane of the endothelial cells is dis-\\nsolved, followed by the rapid production of new endo -\\nthelial cells that stream out of the vessel in extended \\ncords directed toward the source of the angiogenic \\nfactor. The cells continue to divide and eventually fold \\nover into a tube. The tube then connects with another \\ntube budding from another donor vessel and forms a '),\n",

If the \\nflow is sufficient, smooth muscle cells eventually invade \\nthe wall so that some of these vessels grow to be small \\narterioles and/or perhaps even larger vessels.\\nCollateral Blood Vessels Develop When an Artery or a \\nVein Is Blocked. New vascular channels usually develop \\naround a blocked artery or vein and allow the affected \\ntissue to be at least partially resupplied with blood. An \\nimportant example is the development of collateral \\nblood vessels after thrombosis of one of the coronary \\narteries. Many people older than 60 years have blockage \\nof at least one of the smaller coronary vessels, yet most \\npeople do not know that it has happened because \\ncollateral blood vessels have gradually developed as the \\nvessels have begun to close, thereby providing blood \\nflow to the tissue sufficient to prevent myocardial \\ndamage. It is in instances in which thrombosis occurs \\ntoo rapidly for the development of collateral blood \\nvessels that serious heart attacks occur.\\nVascular Remodeling in Response to Chronic \\nChanges in Blood Flow or Blood Pressure\\nThe structure of large blood vessels also adapts to \\nlong-term changes in blood pressure and blood flow. \\nIn chronic hypertension, for example, the large and \\nsmall arteries and arterioles remodel to accommodate \\nthe increased stress of higher blood pressure. In small \\nblood vessels that constrict in response to increased \\nblood pressure, the vascular smooth muscle cells and \\nendothelial cells gradually (over a period of several days \\nor weeks) rearrange themselves around the smaller \\nlumen diameter; this process is called inward eutrophic \\nremodeling and results in no change in the total cross-\\nsectional area of the vascular wall (Figure 17–1).\\nIn larger arteries that do not constrict in response \\nto the increased pressure, the vessel wall is exposed \\nto increased wall tension that stimulates a hypertro-\\nphic remodeling response and an increase in the cross-\\nsectional area of the vascular wall. The hypertrophic \\nresponse increases the size of vascular smooth muscle \\ncells and stimulates the formation of additional extracel-\\nlular matrix that reinforces the strength of the vascular \\nwall to withstand the higher pressures.\\nVascular remodeling also occurs when a blood ves -\\nsel is exposed chronically to increased or decreased \\nblood flow. After creation of a fistula connecting a large \\nartery and a large vein, the blood flow rate increases in \\nthe artery (due to a reduction in downstream vascular '),\n",

However, wall thick-\\nness, lumen diameter, and cross-sectional area of the \\nvascular wall on the venous side of the fistula increase in \\nresponse to increases in pressure and blood flow ( out-\\nward hypertrophic remodeling).\\nThese patterns of remodeling suggest that long-\\nterm increases in vascular wall tension cause hyper -\\ntrophy and increased wall thickness in large blood \\nvessels, while increased blood flow rate causes outward \\nremodeling and increased luminal diameter in order to \\naccommodate the increased blood flow. Chronic reduc-\\ntions in blood pressure and blood flow have the oppo -\\nsite effects. Thus, vascular remodeling is an important \\nadaptive response of the blood vessels to tissue growth \\nand development, as well as to physiological and patho-\\nlogical changes in blood pressure and tissue blood flow.\\nInward eutrophic\\nremodeling\\nHypertrophic\\nremodeling\\nOutward\\nremodeling\\nOutward\\nhypertrophic\\nremodeling\\nFigure 17–1 V ascular remodeling in response to a chronic increase in \\nblood pressure or blood flow.'),\n",

During heavy exercise, arterial pressure may \\nrise as much as 30 percent to 40 percent.\\nThe rise in arterial pressure during exercise is \\nbelieved to result mainly from the following effect: At \\nthe same time the motor areas of the nervous system \\nbecome activated to cause exercise, most of the reticular \\nactivating system in the brain is also activated, which \\ngreatly increases stimulation of the vasoconstrictor and \\ncardioaccelerator areas of the vasomotor center. These \\neffects increase the arterial pressure instantly to keep \\npace with increased muscle activity.

Signals from the \\ncarotid sinus receptors are transmitted through Herring’s \\nnerve to the glossopharyngeal nerve and then to the \\nnucleus tractus solitarius in the medullary area of the \\nbrain stem. Signals from the aortic arch are transmitted \\nthrough the vagus nerves to the same area of the medulla. \\nThe baroreceptors control arterial pressure as follows:\\n •  Inc reased pressure in blood vessels containing baro -\\nreceptors causes increased impulse firing.\\n •  B aroreceptor signals enter the nucleus tractus soli -\\ntarius, inhibit the vasoconstrictor center of the \\nmedulla, and excite the vagal center.\\n •  The ne t effects are inhibition of sympathetic ac -\\ntivity and stimulation of parasympathetic activity, \\nwhich cause (1) vasodilation of veins and arterioles  \\nand (2) decreased heart rate  and strength of heart \\ncontraction.\\n •  V asodilation of veins and arterioles and decreased \\nheart rate and strength of heart contraction cause \\nthe arterial pressure to decrease because of a decline \\nin peripheral vascular resistance and cardiac output.\\nThe Baroreceptors Maintain Arterial Pressure at a \\nRelatively Constant Level During Changes in Body Posture \\nand Other Daily Activities.

To illustrate why the renal–body fluid \\nfeedback mechanism demonstrates nearly “infinite \\ngain” in controlling blood pressure, let us assume that \\nthe arterial pressure rises to 150 mm Hg. At this level, \\nrenal output of water and salt is about three times more \\nthan the intake. The body loses fluid, blood volume \\ndecreases, and arterial pressure decreases. Furthermore, \\nthis loss of fluid does not cease until the arterial pressure \\ndecreases to the equilibrium point (see Figure 19–1, \\ncurve A). Conversely, if blood pressure falls below the \\nequilibrium point, the kidneys decrease salt and water \\nexcretion to a level below intake, causing accumulation \\nof fluid and blood volume until arterial pressure returns \\nto the equilibrium point.

For arterial \\npressure to deviate from the normal level for long \\nperiods, one of these two factors must be altered.\\nIn curve B of Figure 19–1, an abnormality of the kid-\\nney has caused the renal output curve to shift 50 mm Hg \\ntoward higher blood pressure. This shift results in a new \\nequilibrium point, and arterial pressure follows to this \\nnew pressure level within a few days. Although greater \\nsalt and water intake can theoretically elevate arterial \\npressure (discussed later), the body has multiple neuro-\\nhumoral mechanisms that protect against large increases \\nin arterial pressure when salt and water intake is elevated. \\nThis protection against large increases in arterial pres-\\nsure is accomplished mainly by decreasing the formation \\nof angiotensin II and aldosterone, which increases the \\nability of the kidneys to excrete salt and water and results \\nin a steep renal output curve. Therefore, the chronic \\nrenal output curve is much steeper than the acute \\ncurve shown in Figure 19–1, and in most persons large \\nincreases in salt and water output can be accomplished \\nwith minimal increases in arterial pressure.\\nIncreased Total Peripheral Vascular Resistance Does \\nNot Elevate the Long-Term Arterial Pressure if Fluid Intake \\nor Renal Function Does Not Change . When total peripheral \\nvascular resistance is acutely increased, arterial \\npressure increases almost immediately. However, if \\nvascular resistance of the kidneys is not increased and \\nthey continue to function normally, the acute rise in \\narterial pressure is not maintained. The reason for this \\nphenomenom is that increasing resistance everywhere \\nin the body except in the kidneys does not change \\nthe equilibrium point for blood pressure as dictated \\nby the renal output curve. With increased peripheral \\nresistance and arterial pressure, the kidneys undergo \\npressure diuresis and pressure natriuresis, causing loss \\nof salt and water from the body. This loss continues until \\nthe arterial pressure returns to the normal equilibrium \\npoint (see Figure 19–1, curve A).\\nIn many cases, when total peripheral resistance \\nincreases, renal vascular resistance also increases, \\nwhich causes hypertension by shifting the renal func -\\ntion curve to higher blood pressures. When this shift \\noccurs, it is the increase in renal vascular resistance, not \\nthe increase in total peripheral resistance, that causes \\nthe long-term increase in arterial pressure.\\nIncreased Fluid Volume Can Elevate Arterial Pressure \\nif Vascular Capacity Does Not Increase .

Angiotensin II causes salt and \\nwater retention by the kidneys in two ways:\\n •  Angiotensin acts directly on the kidneys to cause salt \\nand water retention. Angiotensin II constricts the ef-\\nferent arterioles, which diminishes blood flow through \\nthe peritubular capillaries, increasing reabsorption \\nfrom the tubules. In addition, angiotensin II directly \\nstimulates the epithelial cells of the renal tubules to \\nincrease reabsorption of sodium and water.\\n •  Angiotensin II stimulates the adrenal glands to secrete \\naldosterone, and aldosterone increases salt and water \\nreabsorption by the epithelial cells of the renal tubule.\\nThe Renin-Angiotensin System Helps Maintain Normal \\nArterial Pressure During Wide Variations in Salt Intake . One \\nof the most important functions of the renin-angiotensin \\nsystem is to allow a person to ingest either a very small or \\nvery large amount of salt without causing great changes in \\neither extracellular fluid volume or arterial pressure. For \\nexample, when salt intake is increased, there is a tendency \\nfor extracellular fluid volume and arterial pressure to \\nincrease. Increased salt intake also decreases renin \\nsecretion and angiotensin II formation, which in turn \\ndecreases renal tubular salt and water reabsorption. The \\nreduced tubular reabsorption allows the person to excrete \\nthe extra amounts of salt and water with minimal increases \\nin extracellular fluid volume and arterial pressure.\\nWhen salt intake is decreased below normal levels, \\nopposite effects occur.

Because of poor blood \\nflow through the kidney after a reduction of renal artery \\npressure, large quantities of renin are secreted, caus-\\ning increased angiotensin II formation and a rapid rise \\nin blood pressure. A more delayed rise in blood pres-\\nsure, occurring over a period of several days, is caused \\nby fluid retention. The fluid retention and expansion of \\nthe extracellular fluid volume continue until the arterial \\npressure has risen sufficiently to return the renal perfu-\\nsion pressure to almost normal levels.\\nHypertension also occurs when the artery of one \\nkidney is constricted and the artery of the other kidney \\nis normal, which is often called two-kidney Goldblatt \\nhypertension. The constricted kidney retains salt and \\nwater because of decreased arterial pressure in this kid-\\nney. The “normal” kidney retains salt and water because \\nof the renin produced in the ischemic kidney and the \\nincrease in circulating angiotensin II, which causes the \\nopposite kidney to retain salt and water.

The renal–body fluid \\nfeedback control mechanism takes several hours to show \\nany significant response, but then it operates powerfully to \\ncontrol arterial pressure over days, weeks, and months. As \\nlong as kidney function is unaltered, disturbances that tend \\nto alter arterial pressure, such as increased total peripheral \\nresistance, have minimal effect on blood pressure over \\nlong periods. Factors that alter the ability of the kidneys to \\nexcrete salt and water can cause major long-term changes \\nin arterial pressure. This mechanism, if given sufficient \\ntime, controls the arterial pressure at a level that provides \\nnormal output of salt and water by the kidneys.\\nMany factors can affect the renal–body fluid feed-\\nback mechanism and therefore long-term blood pres -\\nsure control. One of the most important factors is the \\nrenin-angiotensin system, which allows a person to \\nhave very low or very high salt intake with minimal \\nchanges in arterial pressure. Thus, arterial pressure \\ncontrol begins with lifesaving measures of the nervous \\nreflexes, continues with the sustaining characteristics of \\nthe intermediate pressure controls, and finally is stabi-\\nlized at the long-term pressure level by the renal–body \\nfluid feedback mechanism.'),\n",

It also represents the \\nquantity of blood that flows to the peripheral circulation; \\nthe cardiac output transports substances to and from the \\ntissues. The cardiac output of an average adult is approxi-\\nmately 5 L/min, and cardiac index, which is cardiac output \\nper square meter of body surface area, is 3 L/min/m2.\\nVenous return is the amount of blood that flows from \\nthe veins back to the right atrium each minute.\\nCONTROL OF CARDIAC OUTPUT BY VENOUS \\nRETURN—THE FRANK-STARLING MECHANISM \\nOF THE HEART (p. 245)\\nIn the absence of changes in cardiac strength, cardiac \\noutput is controlled by factors that affect venous return. \\nOne of the most important regulators of venous return \\nis metabolism of the tissues. An increase in the tissue \\nmetabolic rate results in local vasodilation, which causes a \\ndecrease in total peripheral resistance and thus an increase \\nin venous return. This greater venous return causes an \\nincrease in diastolic filling pressure in the ventricles, which \\nin turn results in a greater force of contraction by the ven-\\ntricles. This mechanism for increasing cardiac pumping \\nability is called the Frank-Starling law of the heart. The \\nlaw states that, within limits, an increase in the volume of \\nblood returning to the heart stretches the cardiac muscle a \\ngreater amount, and the heart contracts with greater force \\nand pumps out all the excess venous return.\\nAn important concept that can be learned from \\nthe Frank-Starling law is that, except for momentary \\nchanges, cardiac output equals venous return. Therefore, \\nfactors that control venous return also control cardiac \\noutput. If this were not so—for example, if the cardiac \\noutput were to be greater than the venous return—the \\nlungs would quickly be emptied of blood. In contrast, if \\nthe cardiac output were less than the venous return, the \\nlung vasculature would rapidly fill with blood.\\nWhen venous return increases, the right atrial stretch \\nelicits two reflexes that help increase the cardiac output. \\nFirst, the stretch of the sinus node causes a direct effect \\non the firing rate of the node, resulting in a 10 to 15 per-\\ncent increase in heart rate. This increase in heart rate helps \\npump the extra blood that is returning to the heart. Second, \\nCHAPTER 20\\nCardiac Output, Venous Return, and Their \\nRegulation'),\n",

This reflex causes an increase in heart rate, \\nwhich also helps pump out the excess venous return. This \\nreflex, along with the Frank-Starling law, helps maintain \\nthe volumes of the cardiac chambers within normal limits.\\nCardiac Output Regulation Is the Sum of All Tissue Blood \\nFlow Regulation. Because venous return is the sum of all \\nlocal blood flows, anything that affects local blood flow \\nalso affects the venous return and cardiac output.\\nLocal metabolism is one of the main ways that \\nlocal blood flow can be changed. For example, if the \\nbiceps muscle of the right arm is used repetitively to \\nlift a weight, the metabolic rate of that muscle quickly \\nincreases, causing rapid local vasodilation. Blood flow \\nto the biceps muscle thus quickly increases, which in \\nturn causes an increase in venous return and cardiac \\noutput. Remarkably, the increased cardiac output goes \\nprimarily to the area of increased metabolism, the \\nbiceps, because of its vasodilation.\\nChanges in Cardiac Output Can Be Predicted by Ohm’s \\nLaw. Ohm’s law, as applied to the circulation, can be \\nstated as the following relationship:\\nCardiac output Arterial pressure\\nTotal peripheral resistance\\nRight atrial pressure\\nIf the right atrial pressure is equal to its normal value \\nof 0 mm Hg, the relationship can be simplified to the \\nfollowing equation:\\nCardiac output Arterial pressure\\nTotal peripheral resistance\\nIf the arterial pressure is assumed to be constant, \\nthis formula can be used to accurately predict changes \\nin flow that are due to changes in total peripheral resis-\\ntance. If we return to the example of an increase in the \\nmetabolic rate in a peripheral tissue, the increase in \\noxygen use that also occurs elicits local vasodilation and \\ndecreases total peripheral resistance, which causes an \\nincrease in oxygen delivery to local tissues, an increase \\nin venous return, and an increase in cardiac output. \\nThus, if the arterial pressure is constant, the long-term \\ncardiac output varies in a reciprocal manner with total \\nperipheral resistance. Therefore, a decrease in total \\nperi pheral r esistance increases the cardiac output, and \\nan increase in total peripheral resistance decreases it.'),\n",

The hypervolemia \\ndistends the veins and thus decreases venous resistance, \\nfurther adding to the increase in venous return.\\nCHAPTER 22\\nCardiac Failure'),\n",

The undamaged \\nmyocardium hypertrophies, which offsets much of the \\ncardiac damage and helps increase the cardiac output. \\nRecovery of the cardiac output to normal levels for \\nsustained periods is referred to as compensated failure. \\nCompensated failure has the following features:\\n •  Re latively normal cardiac output as long as the \\nperson remains at rest and places no additional de -\\nmands on the heart\\n •  Inc reased right atrial pressure, which causes en -\\ngorgement of the jugular veins\\n •  Decreased cardiac reserve\\n •  Increased heart rate\\n •  Pale or c lammy skin (which normalizes after recovery)\\n •  S weating and nausea (which also normalize after \\nrecovery)\\n •  Air hunger (dyspnea)\\n •  W eight gain as a result of fluid retention\\nOne of the key diagnostic features of a patient in com-\\npensated heart failure is increased right atrial pressure \\nand the resultant distended neck veins.

In \\nsome patients, the heart is too weak to restore cardiac \\noutput to a level adequate to maintain the nutritional \\nneeds of the body and to make the kidneys excrete the \\nnecessary daily amounts of fluid. Therefore, the kidneys \\ncontinue to retain fluid, and the heart muscle continues \\nto be stretched until the interdigitation of the actin and \\nmyosin filaments is well past optimal levels. Cardiac \\ncontractility then decreases further, and a vicious cycle \\nensues. Decompensated heart failure is believed to have \\nthe following causes:\\n •  L ongitudinal tubules of the sarcoplasmic reticulum \\nfail to accumulate sufficient calcium, which is one of \\nthe basic causes of myocardial weakness.\\n •  M yocardial weakness causes excess fluid retention, \\nwhich in turn causes overstretched sarcomeres and \\nfurther decreases in cardiac contractility.\\n •  E xcess fluid retention also causes edema of the heart \\nmuscle, which results in a stiffened ventricular wall \\nof the heart and in turn inhibits diastolic filling.\\n •  Nor epinephrine content of the sympathetic nerve \\nendings of the heart decreases to very low levels, \\nwhich further decreases cardiac contractility.\\nThere are several treatments for decompensated \\nheart failure, including the following:\\n •  Use of diuretics  such as furosemide. This agent also \\ncauses immediate venodilation, which decreases the \\npreload on the heart.\\n •  Use of a cardiotonic drug such as digitalis. This drug is \\nbelieved to decrease calcium transport out of the myo -\\ncardial cells by the Na-Ca exchanger.

The decreased pressure results in a \\ndecrease in coronary flow, which can weaken the heart \\nand further decrease cardiac output and arterial pres -\\nsure. To break this vicious cycle, the following treat -\\nments are used:\\n •  Digitalis is used to increase cardiac strength.\\n •  A vasopressor drug is given to increase arterial \\npressure.\\n •  Blood or plasma is administered to increase arterial \\npressure.

Heart sounds are \\nassociated with closure of the heart valves;  no sounds \\noccur when the valves are open except a mitral snap that \\ncan sometimes be heard on opening of the mitral value.\\nWhen one listens to the heart with a stethoscope, \\nthe sounds are described as lub, dub, lub, dub. The “lub” \\nis associated with closure of the atrioventricular (A-V) \\nvalves at the beginning of systole; the “dub” occurs at \\nthe end of systole, caused by closure of the aortic and \\npulmonary valves.\\nThe First Heart Sound  Is Associated With Closure of \\nthe A-V Valves. Vibration of the valves and surrounding \\nblood, ventricular wall, and major vessels around \\nthe heart causes the first heart sound. The closure of \\nthese valves at the beginning of systole is caused by \\nthe effects of ventricular contraction, which increases \\nintraventricular pressure and results in a backflow of \\nblood against the A-V valves. After these valves close, \\nthe back-and-forth vibration of the elastic valve leaflets \\nand chordae tendineae causes reverberation of the \\nsurrounding blood and ventricular walls. The mitral \\nvalve closes first, followed by the tricuspid valve.\\nThe Second Heart Sound Is Associated With Closure of \\nthe Aortic and Pulmonary Valves. The second heart sound \\noccurs at the end of systole, when the total energy of \\nthe blood in the ventricles is less than that in the aorta \\nand pulmonary artery. This causes the semilunar \\nvalves (aortic and pulmonary) to close and again starts \\na vibration in the valve leaflets and the surrounding \\nblood, ventricular wall, and blood vessels. When the \\nvibration of these structures contacts the chest wall, the \\nsound, with proper amplification, can be heard from \\noutside the body. The aortic valve closes first, followed \\nby the pulmonary valve.\\nComparison of the first and second heart sounds \\nshows that the first sound, the lub, is louder because \\nof the high rate of change of pressure across the A-V \\nvalves. In addition, the first heart sound has a lower \\npitch than that of the second heart sound because of \\nthe low elastic modulus of the valves and the greater \\namount of blood vibrating in the ventricles than in the \\nCHAPTER 23\\nHeart Valves and Heart Sounds; Valvular \\nand Congenital Heart Defects'),\n",

This effect is analogous to \\nthe lower pitch made by the thick strings of a piano or \\nguitar after being struck.\\nThe Third Heart Sound  Occurs at the Beginning of \\nthe Middle Third of Diastole. The cause of the sound is \\nthought to be an in-rushing of blood into the ventricles. \\nThis heart sound is heard only after sufficient blood has \\nentered the ventricles to create the elastic tension in the \\nwalls, which is necessary for reverberation. This sound \\ncan be heard with the bell of the stethoscope in normal \\nchildren and young adults or in persons older than 40 \\nyears with heart disease, and it can be recorded with a \\nphonocardiogram.\\nThe Fourth Heart Sound  Is Associated With Atrial \\nContraction. An atrial heart sound is difficult to hear \\nwith a stethoscope except in patients with a thickened \\nleft ventricular wall, which is often associated with \\nhypertensive patients. The sound is associated with \\natrial contraction and the associated inflow of blood into \\nthe ventricles. It occurs during the last third of diastole.\\nMost Cardiac Valvular Lesions Result From \\nRheumatic Fever (p. 285)\\nRheumatic fever is an autoimmune disease in which \\na patient’s immune system damages or destroys the \\nheart valves. Patients with this disease contract a group \\nA hemolytic streptococcal infection, and M antigen is \\nreleased by the streptococci. Antibodies form against \\nthe M antigen, and the antigen-antibody complex \\nhas a propensity for attaching to the heart valves. The \\nimmune system then attacks the M antigen–antibody–\\nheart valve complex and causes damage, including hem-\\norrhagic, fibrinous, bulbous lesions.\\nTwo heart valve lesions occur with rheumatic fever:\\n •  Stenotic valves occur if damage to the valves causes \\nthe leaflets to adhere to one another.\\n •  Insufficient or regurgitant valves result if the valves \\nare partially destroyed or cannot properly close; back \\nleak of blood results.\\nHeart Murmurs Are Abnormal Heart Sounds \\nCaused by Valvular Lesions (p. 285)\\nAortic Stenosis Causes a Harsh-Sounding Systolic Murmur. \\nBecause of the small opening in the aortic valve in this \\ncondition, intraventricular pressure must increase to \\nas much as 300 to 400 mm Hg to eject the ventricular \\nblood through the small opening.

The resultant \\nsound is harsh and sometimes can be heard from several \\nfeet away. The vibration can be felt on the upper chest. \\nCommon features of aortic stenosis are:\\n •  Intense left ventricular hypertrophy occurs because \\nof the increased ventricular workload.\\n •  Chronic increase in blood volume occurs as renal \\ncompensation to an initial decrease in arterial pres-\\nsure; the red blood cell mass also increases because \\nof mild hypoxia.\\n •  Chronic increase in left atrial pressure is present \\nsecondary to hypervolemia, which increases venous \\nreturn to the heart.

Because of the lack of ability to close the aortic \\nvalve completely, blood leaks backward through this \\nvalve and into the left ventricle during diastole. The \\nmurmur has a relatively high pitch that is caused by the \\njetting of blood back into the ventricle. The associated \\nvibration is best heard over the left ventricle. The \\nfollowing are features of aortic regurgitation:\\n •  Stroke volume increases  to as high as 300 milliliters \\nwith 70 milliliters to the periphery and 230 milliliters \\nleaking back into the heart.\\n •  Left ventricular hypertrophy  is caused by the in -\\ncreased stroke volume required by the heart.\\n •  Aortic diastolic pressure decreases rapidly because of \\nback leaking of blood into the left ventricle.\\n •  Blood volume chronically increases.\\nCoronary Ischemia Is Often Associated With Aortic \\nValvular Lesions. The amount of left ventricular \\nhypertrophy is particularly large during both aortic \\nstenosis and regurgitation and often is associated \\nwith coronary ischemia. During aortic stenosis, the \\nventricular muscle must develop a very high tension to \\ncreate the high intraventricular pressure needed to force \\nblood through the stenosed aortic valve. The oxygen \\nconsumption of the ventricle increases, necessitating a \\nrise in coronary flow to deliver this oxygen.

Coronary ischemia is very likely to occur \\nwith severe aortic stenosis. With aortic regurgitation, \\nthe intraventricular diastolic pressure also increases, \\nwhich compresses the inner layer of the heart muscle \\nand decreases coronary flow. Aortic diastolic pressure \\nfalls during aortic regurgitation, which can cause a \\ndirect decrease in coronary flow. Both of these mecha-\\nnisms can lead to a decrease in coronary flow and result \\nin coronary ischemia.\\nMitral Stenosis Is a Weak-Sounding Diastolic Murmur \\nThat Is Heard Best During Mid to Late Diastole . With mitral \\nstenosis, blood passes with difficulty from the left atrium \\nto the left ventricle. The left atrium is unable to develop \\na pressure of much more than 30 mm Hg; therefore, the \\nvelocity of blood flow through the mitral valve never \\nincreases dramatically. Sufficient velocity develops to \\ncreate a low-frequency, weak, rumbling murmur that is \\nbest detected using phonocardiography. Mitral stenosis \\nhas the following features:\\n •  Cardiac output and mean arterial pressure may ini-\\ntially decrease but not as much as with aortic ste-\\nnosis. Increases in blood volume will help increase \\ncardiac output back toward normal.\\n •  Atrial volume increases and may lead to atrial fibril -\\nlation.\\n •  Left atrial pressure increases  and may cause pulmo -\\nnary edema.\\n •  Right ventricular failure occurs with severe stenosis \\nbecause the right ventricle must pump much harder \\nowing to an increase in pulmonary artery pressure.\\nABNORMAL CIRCULATORY DYNAMICS \\nASSOCIATED WITH CONGENITAL CARDIAC \\nDEFECTS (p. 286)\\nOccasionally, the heart and associated blood vessels are \\nmalformed during fetal life.

Occasionally the ductus does not close, \\nresulting in a condition called patent ductus arteriosus.\\nIn persons with patent ductus arteriosus, the high \\npressure in the aorta forces blood through the open \\nductus and into the pulmonary artery, and blood recir-\\nculates several times through the lungs. Arterial blood \\noxygen saturation is therefore greater than normal \\nunless heart failure has occurred. Features of patent \\nductus arteriosus are as follows:\\n •  Blood volume increases to compensate for the de -\\ncrease in cardiac output.\\n •  This murmur is heard throughout systole and dias -\\ntole but is louder in systole.\\n •  Cardiac reserve decreases.\\n •  Left ventricular hypertrophy occurs because of the \\nextra blood the left ventricle must pump.\\n •  Right ventricular hypertrophy occurs because of high \\npulmonary artery pressure.\\n •  Pulmonary edema can occur  if the left heart is too \\noverloaded.\\nOther left-to-right shunts that can occur include the \\ninterventricular septal defect and interatrial septal defect.\\nTetralogy of Fallot Is a Right-to-Left Shunt . In persons \\nwith tetralogy of Fallot, four abnormalities of the heart \\noccur simultaneously:\\n 1.   The aor ta is displaced over the ventricular septum \\nand originates from the right ventricle.\\n 2.   A ventricular septal defect is also present, causing \\nthe right ventricle to pump both left and right ven -\\ntricular blood through the aorta.\\n 3.   Pulmonar y artery or pulmonary valve stenosis is also \\npresent, and because of the high pulmonary arte -\\nrial resistance, much of the right ventricular blood \\nshunts around the lungs and enters the aorta. Blood \\noxygen levels can be severely decreased because of \\nlack of blood flow through the lungs.\\n 4.

When the arterial \\npressure falls sufficiently low, the cerebral blood flow \\nbegins to decrease, and flow to the vasomotor center \\nalso decreases. If flow decreases sufficiently, the \\nsympathetic discharge of the vasomotor center falls \\ndramatically, which can result in further reductions \\nin arterial pressure and progressive peripheral \\ncirculatory failure.\\nBlood Clotting in Minute Vessels Also Occurs During \\nProgressive Hemorrhagic Shock. Because of the low blood \\nflow during shock, tissue metabolites, including large \\namounts of carbonic and lactic acid, are not carried \\naway from the tissues properly, allowing local acid \\nconcentrations to build up. The resulting increased \\nconcentration of hydrogen ions and other ischemic \\nproducts causes local agglutination of blood and \\nformation of blood clots.

Dextran and \\nother high-molecular-weight polysaccharide polymers \\nhave been developed and have been proved to remain \\nin the blood compartment after intravenous infusion.\\nBecause Plasma Loss Is the Cause of Hypovolemic Shock \\nin Patients With Intestinal Destruction or Burns, Plasma \\nInfusion Is the Appropriate Therapy . During intestinal \\nobstruction, blockage and distention of the intestines \\npartly impede the venous blood flow and thus increase \\ncapillary pressure and leakage of highly proteinaceous \\nfluid into the intestinal lumen. With severe intestinal \\nblockage, shock can ensue; however, if an intravenous \\nplasma infusion is started soon, hemodynamic condi -\\ntions are rapidly restored to normal. In patients with \\nsevere burns, plasma transudes through the damaged \\nareas of the skin, causing a marked decrease in plasma \\nvolume. The appropriate therapy for the shock that \\nmight occur in a burn patient therefore is intravenous \\ninfusion of plasma.\\nBecause Water and Electrolyte Loss Is the Cause \\nof Hypovolemic Shock in Patients With Dehydration, \\nIntravenous Infusion of a Balanced Electrolyte Solution Is \\nthe Appropriate Therapy. A number of conditions can \\nresult in dehydration, including vomiting, diarrhea, excess \\nperspiration, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, \\nexcessive use of diuretics, destruction of the adrenal \\ncortices with loss of aldosterone, and loss of fluid by \\nnephrotic kidneys. If the dehydration is severe, shock can \\noccur. If a balanced electrolyte solution such as lactated \\nRinger’s solution is rapidly infused intravenously, the \\nproblem can be corrected.\\nTraumatic Shock Can Be Caused by Hypovolemia and \\nPain. Often, a patient with trauma resulting from severe \\ncontusion of the body also experiences hypovolemia. \\nBlood administration can correct this hypovolemia, \\nbut the pain associated with trauma is an additional \\naggravating factor. This pain sometimes inhibits the \\nvasomotor center, resulting in a decrease in sympathetic \\noutput, which can reduce arterial pressure and venous \\nreturn of blood to the heart. Administration of a proper \\nanalgesic can help alleviate the pain and its effects on \\nthe sympathetic nervous system.\\nNeurogenic Shock Is Caused by Increased Vascular \\nCapacity; Therefore, Therapy Should Decrease This \\nCapacity Toward Normal. Neurogenic shock results from \\na sudden loss of vasomotor tone throughout the body, \\nthereby increasing total vascular capacity.

The histamine has several \\neffects:\\n •  Inc reased vascular capacity because of venodilation\\n •  Ar teriolar dilation, which decreases arterial pressure\\n •  Inc reased capillary permeability, causing loss of fluid \\nfrom the vascular compartment\\nThese effects of histamine can decrease arterial pres -\\nsure and venous return, leading to anaphylactic shock. \\nA person may die minutes after anaphylactic shock \\nsymptoms appear.

Therefore, only the most \\nimportant principles as they apply to volume regulation \\nare discussed in this section.\\nOsmosis Is the Net Diffusion of Water Across a \\nSelectively Permeable Membrane. The addition of a \\nsolute to pure water reduces the water concentration \\nand causes water to move toward the region of high \\nsolute concentration. The concentration term used to \\nmeasure the total number of solute particles in solution \\nis the osmole: 1 osmole is equal to 1 mole (6.02 × 10 23) \\nof solute particles. For biological solutions, the term \\nmilliosmole (mOsm), which equals 1/1000 osmole, is \\ncommonly used.\\nThe osmolar concentration of a solution is called \\nits osmolality when the concentration is expressed as \\nosmoles per kilogram of water and osmolarity when it is \\nexpressed as osmoles per liter of solution. The amount of \\npressure required to prevent osmosis of water through \\na semipermeable membrane is called the osmotic pres-\\nsure. Expressed mathematically, the osmotic pressure \\n(π) is directly proportional to the concentration of \\nosmotically active particles in that solution:\\nπ= CRT\\nwhere C is the concentration of solutes in osmoles per \\nliter, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the absolute \\ntemperature in degrees Kelvin. If π is expressed in milli-\\nmeters of mercury (the unit of pressure commonly used \\nfor biologic fluids), π calculates to be about 19.3 mm Hg \\nfor a solution with an osmolarity of 1 mOsm/L. Thus, \\nfor each milliosmole concentration gradient across the \\ncell membrane, 19.3 mm Hg of force is required to pre-\\nvent water diffusion across the membrane. Very small \\ndifferences in solute concentration across the cell mem-\\nbrane can therefore cause rapid osmosis of water.\\nIsotonic, Hypotonic, and Hypertonic Fluids. A solution \\nis said to be isotonic if no osmotic force develops across \\nthe cell membrane when a normal cell is placed in the \\nsolution. An isotonic solution has the same osmolarity \\nas the cell, and the cells do not shrink or swell if placed \\nin the solution. Examples of isotonic solutions include \\na 0.9 percent sodium chloride solution and a 5 percent \\nglucose solution.\\nA solution is said to be hypertonic when it contains \\na higher concentration of osmotic substances than does \\nthe cell. In this case, an osmotic force develops that '),\n",

The osmotic force develops \\nimmediately when the cell is exposed to the solution, \\ncausing water to flow by osmosis into the cell until the \\nintracellular fluid has about the same concentration as \\nthe extracellular fluid or until the cell bursts as a result \\nof excessive swelling.\\nVOLUME AND OSMOLALITY OF EXTRACELLULAR \\nAND INTRACELLULAR FLUIDS IN ABNORMAL \\nSTATES (p. 312)\\nSome of the factors that can cause extracellular and \\nintracellular volumes to change markedly are inges -\\ntion of large amounts of water, dehydration, intra-\\nvenous infusion of various solutions, loss of large \\namounts of fluid from the gastrointestinal tract, and \\nloss of abnormal amounts of fluid via sweating or from \\nthe kidneys.\\nOne can approximate the changes in intracellular \\nand extracellular fluid volumes and the therapy that \\nmust be instituted if the following basic principles are \\nkept in mind:\\n •  Water moves rapidly across cell membranes;  there -\\nfore, osmolarities of intracellular and extracellular \\nfluids remain almost exactly equal to each other \\nexcept for a few minutes after a change in one of the \\ncompartments.\\n •  Cell membranes are almost completely impermeable \\nto most solutes; therefore, the number of osmoles \\nin the extracellular and intracellular fluids remains \\nrelatively constant unless solutes are added to or lost \\nfrom the extracellular compartment.\\nEffects of Adding Isotonic, Hypertonic, and \\nHypotonic Saline Solutions to Extracellular Fluid\\nIf an isotonic solution is added to the extracellular fluid \\ncompartment, extracellular fluid osmolarity does not \\nchange, and there is no osmosis through the cell mem-\\nbranes.

To understand the causes of \\nexcessive capillary filtration, it is useful to review the \\ndeterminants of capillary filtration discussed in Chapter \\n16, as shown in the following equation:\\nFiltration=Kf × (PC −Pif −πC +πif)\\nwhere Kf  is the capillary filtration coefficient (the prod -\\nuct of the permeability and surface area of the capillar -\\nies), Pif  is the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure, πc  is \\nthe capillary plasma colloid osmotic pressure, and πif  is \\nthe interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure. Thus, any \\nof the following changes can increase the capillary filtra-\\ntion rate:\\n 1.   Increased capillary filtration coefficient, which al -\\nlows increased leakage of fluids and plasma proteins \\nthrough the capillary membranes. This can result \\nfrom allergic reactions, bacterial infections, and \\ntoxic substances that injure the capillary membranes \\nand increase their permeability to plasma proteins.\\n 2.

Increased interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure,  \\nwhich draws fluid out of the plasma into the tissues \\nspaces. This situation occurs most often as a result \\nof lymphatic blockage, which prevents the return \\nof protein from interstitial spaces to the blood (dis-\\ncussed in the following sections).\\nLymphatic Blockage Causes Edema. When lymphatic \\nblockage occurs, edema can become especially severe \\nbecause plasma proteins that leak into the interstitium \\nhave no other way to be returned to the plasma. The rise \\nin protein concentration increases the colloid osmotic \\npressure of the interstitial fluid, which draws even more \\nfluid out of the capillaries.\\nBlockage of lymph flow can be especially severe \\nwith infections of the lymph nodes, such as occurs with \\ninfection by filarial nematodes. Lymph vessels may also \\nbe blocked with certain types of cancer or after surgery \\nin which the lymph vessels are removed or obstructed.\\nSafety Factors That Normally Prevent Edema\\nAlthough many abnormalities can cause fluid accumu -\\nlation in interstitial spaces, the disturbances must be \\nsubstantial before clinically significant edema develops. \\nThree major safety factors normally prevent fluid accu-\\nmulation in the interstitial spaces:\\n 1.  The compliance of the tissues is low as long as intersti-\\ntial fluid hydrostatic pressure is in the negative range. \\nLow compliance (defined as the change in volume \\nper millimeter of mercury pressure change) means \\nthat small increases in interstitial fluid volume are \\nassociated with relatively large increases in intersti-\\ntial fluid hydrostatic pressure. When the interstitial \\nfluid volume increases, the interstitial fluid hydro-\\nstatic pressure increases markedly, which opposes \\nfurther excessive capillary filtration. The safety factor \\nthat protects against edema for this effect is about  \\n3 mm Hg in many tissues such as skin.\\n 2.  Lymph flow can increase as much as 10- to 50-fold.  \\nLymph vessels carry away large amounts of fluid and \\nproteins in response to increased capillary filtration. \\nThe safety factor for this effect has been calculated to \\nbe about 7 mm Hg.\\n 3.  A “wash-down” of interstitial fluid protein occurs as \\nlymph flow increases. As increased amounts of fluid \\nare filtered into the interstitium, the interstitial fluid '),\n",

This \\neffect decreases the protein concentration of the in -\\nterstitium because more protein is carried away than \\ncan be filtered by the capillaries. A decrease in tis-\\nsue fluid protein concentration lowers the net filtra-\\ntion force across the capillaries and tends to prevent \\nfurther fluid accumulation. The safety factor for this \\neffect has been calculated to be about 7 mm Hg in \\nmost tissues.\\nWhen combining all of the safety factors, the total \\nsafety factor that protects against edema is about  \\n17 mm Hg.

No \\nmajor changes occur in the composition of the urine as \\nit flows through the ureters into the bladder. Peristaltic \\ncontractions of the ureter, which are enhanced by para-\\nsympathetic stimulation, force the urine from the renal \\npelvis toward the bladder.\\nThe urinary bladder is a smooth muscle chamber \\ncomposed of two main parts: (1) the body, which is the \\nmajor portion of the bladder in which urine collects, \\nand (2) the neck, which is a funnel-shaped extension of \\nthe body that connects with the urethra.\\nThe smooth muscle of the bladder is called the \\ndetrusor muscle. When the fibers contract, they can \\nincrease the pressure of the bladder to 40 to 60 mm Hg \\nand therefore play a major role in emptying the bladder.\\nThe bladder neck (posterior urethra) is composed of \\ndetrusor muscle interlaced with a large amount of elas -\\ntic tissue. The muscle in this area is called the internal \\nsphincter; its natural tone keeps the bladder from emp-\\ntying until the pressure in the main part of the bladder \\nrises above a critical threshold.\\nBeyond the posterior urethra, the urethra passes \\nthrough the urogenital diaphragm, which contains a \\nlayer of muscle called the external sphincter of the blad-\\nder. This muscle is a voluntary skeletal muscle and can be \\nused consciously to prevent urination even when invol-\\nuntary controls are attempting to empty the bladder.'),\n",

Nevertheless, in some \\ndiseases, such as uncontrolled hypertension and diabetes \\nmellitus, GFR is reduced because of increased thickness \\nof the glomerular capillary membrane, which reduces Kf, \\nor because of severe damage to the capillaries and loss of \\ncapillary filtration surface area.\\nIncreased Bowman’s Capsule Pressure Decreases GFR. \\nChanges in Bowman’s capsule pressure normally do not \\ncontrol the GFR; however, in certain pathological states, \\nsuch as urinary tract obstruction, Bowman’s capsule \\npressure may increase to such a high level that GFR is \\nreduced. For example, precipitation of calcium or uric \\nacid may lead to “stones” that lodge in the urinary tract, \\noften in the ureter, thereby obstructing urine flow and \\nincreasing Bowman’s capsule pressure.\\nIncreased Glomerular Capillary Colloid Osmotic Pressure \\nDecreases GFR. The two factors that influence glomerular \\ncapillary colloid osmotic pressure are (1) arterial colloid \\nosmotic pressure and (2) the fraction of plasma filtered \\nby the glomerular capillaries (filtration fraction). An \\nincrease in either the arterial colloid osmotic pressure or \\nfiltration fraction increases the glomerular capillary colloid \\nosmotic pressure. Conversely, a decrease in arterial plasma \\ncolloid osmotic pressure or filtration fraction reduces the \\nglomerular colloid osmotic pressure. Because filtration \\nfraction is the GFR/renal plasma flow ratio, a decrease in \\nrenal plasma flow increases filtration fraction. Therefore, \\neven with constant glomerular hydrostatic pressure, \\ndecreased renal blood flow tends to increase the glomerular \\ncolloid osmotic pressure and decrease the GFR.\\nIncreased Glomerular Capillary Hydrostatic Pressure \\nIncreases the GFR. Glomerular hydrostatic pressure \\nis determined by three variables, each of which is \\nphysiologically regulated:\\n •  Arterial pressure.

Increased efferent arte-\\nriolar resistance increases resistance to outflow of the \\nglomerular capillaries and raises glomerular hydrostat-\\nic pressure, thereby tending to increase GFR as long as \\nthe increased efferent resistance does not reduce renal \\nblood flow to a great extent (see Figure 27–1).

Many of the nutrients, such \\nas glucose and amino acids, are reabsorbed through \\nsecondary active transport with sodium. In most \\ninstances, reabsorption of these substances displays \\na transport maximum, which refers to the maximum \\nrate of reabsorption. When the filtered load of these \\nsubstances exceeds the transport maximum, the excess \\namount is excreted. The threshold is the tubular load \\nat which the transport maximum is exceeded in one \\nor more nephrons, resulting in the appearance of that \\nsolute in the urine. The threshold usually occurs at a \\nslightly lower tubular load than the transport maximum '),\n",

Some parts \\nof the renal tubule, especially the proximal tubules, are \\nhighly permeable to water, and reabsorption occurs so \\nrapidly that there is only a small concentration gradient \\nacross the membrane. In the ascending loops of Henle, \\nhowever, water permeability is always low, so almost no \\nwater is reabsorbed despite a large osmotic gradient. \\nIn the distal tubules, collecting tubules, and collecting \\nducts, water permeability depends on the presence or \\nabsence of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). In the presence \\nof ADH, these sections of the renal tubule are highly \\npermeable to water.\\nSome Solutes Are Reabsorbed by Passive Diffusion . \\nWhen sodium, a positive ion, is reabsorbed through the \\ntubular cell, negative ions such as chloride also tend to \\ndiffuse passively through the paracellular pathway (between \\nthe cells). Additional reabsorption of chloride also occurs \\nbecause of a concentration gradient that develops when \\nwater is reabsorbed from the tubule by osmosis, thereby \\nconcentrating the chloride ions in the tubular lumen.\\nNoncharged substances, such as urea, are also pas -\\nsively reabsorbed from the tubule because osmotic reab-\\nsorption of water tends to concentrate these solutes in \\nthe tubular lumen, favoring their diffusion into the renal \\ninterstitium.

The loop of Henle \\ndips into the inner part of the kidney, the renal medulla, \\nand plays an important role in allowing the kidney to form \\nconcentrated urine. The descending thin loop of Henle is \\nhighly permeable to water, which is rapidly reabsorbed \\nfrom the tubular fluid into the hyperosmotic interstitium \\n(osmolarity rises to 1200-1400 mOsm/L in the inner renal \\nmedulla); approximately 20 percent of the glomerular \\nfiltrate volume is reabsorbed in the thin descending loop of \\nHenle, causing the tubular fluid to become hyperosmotic \\nas it moves toward the inner renal medulla.\\nIn the thin and thick segments of the ascending \\nloop of Henle, water permeability is virtually zero, but \\nlarge amounts of sodium, chloride, and potassium are \\nreabsorbed, causing the tubular fluid to become dilute \\n(hypotonic) as it moves back toward the cortex. At the \\nsame time, active transport of sodium chloride out of \\nthe thick ascending loop of Henle into the interstitium \\ncauses a very high concentration of these ions in the \\ninterstitial fluid of the renal medulla. As in the proxi-\\nmal tubule, reabsorption of sodium chloride in the loop \\nof Henle is closely linked to activity of the sodium-\\npotassium ATPase pump in the basolateral membrane. \\nIn addition, sodium chloride is rapidly transported \\nacross the luminal membrane by a 1-sodium, 2-chloride, \\n1-potassium co-transporter. About 25% of the filtered \\nloads of sodium, chloride, and potassium are reabsorbed \\nin the loop of Henle, mostly in the thick ascending limb. \\nConsiderable amounts of other ions, such as calcium, \\nbicarbonate, and magnesium, are also reabsorbed in the \\nthick ascending loop of Henle.\\nThe thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle is the site \\nof action of the powerful loop diuretics furosemide (Lasix), \\nethacrynic acid, and bumetanide, all of which inhibit the \\n1-sodium, 2-chloride, 1-potassium co-transporter.\\nThe Early Distal Tubule Dilutes the Tubular Fluid .

The second halves of the distal tubules and the \\ncortical collecting tubules have similar functional char -\\nacteristics. Anatomically, they are composed of two \\ndistinct cell types: the principal cells, which reabsorb \\nsodium and water from the lumen and secrete potassium \\ninto the lumen, and the intercalated cells, which can \\nreabsorb potassium ions and secrete hydrogen ions into \\nthe tubular lumen.\\nThe tubular membranes of both segments are almost \\ncompletely impermeable to urea, and their permeability \\nto water is controlled by the ADH concentration. With \\nhigh levels of ADH, these segments are highly perme-\\nable to water. The reabsorption of sodium and secretion \\nof potassium by the principal cells are controlled by the \\nhormone aldosterone. Secretion of hydrogen ions by the \\nintercalated cells plays an important role in acid-base \\nregulation of the body fluids (discussed later).\\nThe principal cells are the main sites of action of \\npotassium-sparing diuretics,  including spironolactone \\nand eplerenone  (antagonists of aldosterone’s effects \\nof the mineralocorticoid receptor) and amiloride (a \\nsodium channel blocker).\\nThere are two types of intercalated cells, type A and \\ntype B. Type A intercalated cells  secrete hydrogen ions \\nby a hydrogen-ATPase transporter and by a hydrogen-\\npotassium-ATPase transporter that also reabsorbs \\npotassium ions. Type A intercalated cells are especially \\nimportant in eliminating hydrogen ions while reabsorb-\\ning bicarbonate in acidosis. Type B intercalated cells  \\nhave functions opposite to those of type A cells and \\nsecrete bicarbonate into the tubular lumen while reab-\\nsorbing hydrogen ions in alkalosis.\\nMedullary Collecting Ducts Are the Final Sites for \\nProcessing the Urine. Although the medullary collecting \\nducts reabsorb less than 10 percent of the filtered water and \\nsodium, they are extremely important when determining \\nthe final urine output of water and solutes.

An important feature of tubular reabsorption \\nis that excretion of water and solutes can be indepen -\\ndently regulated, especially through hormonal control.\\nGlomerulotubular Balance—The Ability of the Tubule \\nto Increase its Reabsorption Rate in Response to a Greater \\nTubular Load. If GFR is increased, the absolute rate of \\ntubular reabsorption is increased approximately in \\nproportion to the rise in GFR. Glomerulotubular balance \\nhelps prevent overloading of the more distal parts of \\nthe renal tubule when the GFR increases; however, \\nglomerulotubular balance does not completely prevent \\nchanges in the GFR from altering urinary excretion.\\nPeritubular Capillary and Renal Interstitial Fluid Physical \\nForces Influence Tubular Reabsorption. As the glomerular \\nfiltrate passes through the renal tubules, more than \\n99 percent of the water and most of the solutes are \\nreabsorbed—first into the renal interstitium and then \\ninto the peritubular capillaries. Of the fluid that is \\nnormally filtered by the glomerular capillaries (125 ml/\\nmin), approximately 124 ml/min is reabsorbed into the \\nperitubular capillaries.\\nPeritubular capillary reabsorption is regulated by \\nhydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures acting across \\nthe capillaries and by the capillary filtration coefficient \\n(Kf ), as shown in the following equation:\\nReabsorption = Kf(Pc − Pif −π c +π if)\\nwhere Pc is the peritubular capillary hydrostatic pres -\\nsure, Pif is the interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure, πc is \\nthe colloid osmotic pressure of the peritubular capillary \\nplasma proteins, and πif is the colloid osmotic pressure '),\n",

The two primary \\ndeterminants of peritubular capillary reabsorption that \\nare directly influenced by renal hemodynamic changes \\nare the hydrostatic and colloid osmotic pressures of the \\nperitubular capillaries. The peritubular capillary hydro-\\nstatic pressure, in turn, is influenced by (1) the arterial \\npressure and (2) the resistance of the afferent and effer-\\nent arterioles (Table 28–2).\\nThe peritubular capillary colloid osmotic pressure is \\ninfluenced by (1) the systemic plasma colloid osmotic \\npressure and (2) the filtration fraction, which is the \\nGFR/renal plasma flow ratio. The higher the filtration \\nfraction, the greater is the fraction of plasma that is fil-\\ntered through the glomerular capillaries; consequently, \\nthe more concentrated become the proteins in the \\nplasma that remains behind. An increase in filtration \\nfraction therefore tends to increase the peritubular cap-\\nillary reabsorption rate.\\nIncreased Arterial Pressure Reduces Tubular \\nReabsorption. Even small increases in arterial pressure \\ncan increase the urinary excretion rates of sodium and \\nwater, phenomena referred to as pressure natriuresis \\nand pressure diuresis, respectively. There are at least \\nthree major mechanisms by which increased arterial \\npressure increases urinary excretion:\\n 1.  Inc reased arterial pressure causes slight elevations in \\nrenal blood flow and GFR; in normal kidneys, GFR \\nand renal blood flow usually change less than 10 per-\\ncent between arterial pressures of 75 and 160 mm \\nHg because of the renal autoregulatory mechanisms \\ndiscussed in Chapter 27.\\nTable 28–2  Factors That Can Influence Peritubular \\nCapillary Reabsorption\\n↑ Pc → ↓ Reabsorption\\n↓ RA → ↑ Pc\\n↓ RE → ↑ Pc\\n↑ Arterial pressure → ↑ Pc\\n↑ πc → ↑ Reabsorption\\n↑ πA → ↑ πc\\n↑ FF → ↑ πc\\n↑ Capillary filtration coefficient → ↑ Reabsorption\\nπc, peritubular capillary colloid osmotic pressure; πA, systemic plasma colloid \\nosmotic pressure; FF, filtration fraction; Pc, peritubular capillary hydrostatic pres-\\nsure; RA and RE, afferent and efferent arteriolar resistances, respectively.'),\n",

Inc reased arterial pressure also decreases angioten -\\nsin II formation, which greatly decreases sodium re -\\nabsorption by the renal tubules (discussed later).\\nAldosterone Increases Sodium Reabsorption and \\nPotassium Secretion. Aldosterone, which is secreted by the \\nadrenal cortex, acts on mineralocorticoid receptors on the \\nprincipal cells of the cortical collecting tubule to stimulate \\nthe sodium-potassium ATPase pump, which increases \\nsodium reabsorption from the tubule and potassium \\nsecretion into the tubule. In the absence of aldosterone, \\nas occurs with destruction or malfunction of the adrenals \\n(Addison’s disease), there is marked loss of sodium from \\nthe body and accumulation of potassium. Conversely, \\nexcess aldosterone secretion, as occurs in patients with \\nadrenal tumors (Conn’s syndrome), is associated with \\nsodium retention and potassium depletion.\\nAngiotensin II Increases Sodium and Water Reabsorption . \\nAngiotensin II, the most powerful sodium-retaining \\nhormone of the body, increases sodium and water \\nreabsorption through three main effects:\\n 1.   Ang iotensin II stimulates aldosterone secretion, \\nwhich in turn increases sodium reabsorption.\\n 2.   Ang iotensin II constricts efferent arterioles, which \\nreduces peritubular capillary hydrostatic pressure \\nand increases filtration fraction by reducing renal \\nblood flow. Both of these effects tend to increase the \\nreabsorptive force at the peritubular capillaries and \\ntubular reabsorption of sodium and water.\\n 3.   Ang iotensin II directly stimulates sodium reabsorp -\\ntion in most tubular segments.\\nThese multiple actions of angiotensin II cause \\nmarked sodium and water retention by the kidneys in \\ncircumstances associated with low blood pressure, low \\nextracellular fluid volume, or both, such as during hem -\\norrhage or loss of salt and water from body fluids.\\nADH Increases Water Reabsorption. ADH, secreted \\nby the posterior pituitary gland, increases water \\npermeability of the distal tubules, collecting tubules, and \\ncollecting ducts.

Specific cells of the cardiac atria, when \\ndistended as a result of plasma volume expansion, secrete \\na peptide called atrial natriuretic peptide. Greater levels \\nof this peptide inhibit reabsorption of sodium and water \\nby the renal tubules, thereby increasing the excretion of \\nsodium and water.\\nParathyroid Hormone Increases Calcium Reabsorption \\nand Decreases Phosphate Reabsorption . Parathyroid \\nhormone is one of the most important calcium- and \\nphosphate-regulating hormones of the body. Its principal \\naction in the kidneys is to increase reabsorption of \\ncalcium, especially in the distal tubules. Another action \\nof parathyroid hormone is inhibition of phosphate \\nreabsorption by proximal tubules.\\nSympathetic Nervous System Activation Increases Sodium \\nReabsorption. Stimulation of the sympathetic nervous \\nsystem constricts afferent and efferent arterioles, thereby \\ndecreasing GFR. At the same time, sympathetic activation \\ndirectly increases sodium reabsorption in the proximal \\ntubule, ascending loop of Henle, and distal tubule while \\nstimulating renin release and angiotensin II formation.\\nUSE OF CLEARANCE METHODS TO QUANTIFY \\nKIDNEY FUNCTION (p. 365)\\nRenal Clearance Is the Volume of Plasma That Is \\nCompletely Cleared of a Substance Each Minute . For a \\ngiven substance X, renal clearance is defined as the ratio \\nof the excretion rate of substance X to its concentration \\nin the plasma, as shown by the following relation:\\nCX = (UX ×V)\\nPX\\nwhere CX is renal clearance in milliliters per minute, UX \\n× V is the excretion rate of substance X (U X is the con-\\ncentration of X in the urine, and V is urine flow rate in \\nmilliliters per minute), and PX is the plasma concentra-\\ntion of X.

Some substances, \\nsuch as para-aminohippuric acid (PAH), are freely \\nfiltered and are not reabsorbed by the tubules but are \\nsecreted into the tubules; therefore, the renal clearance \\nof these substances is greater than the GFR. In fact, \\nabout 90 percent of the plasma flowing through the \\nkidney is completely cleared of PAH, and renal clearance \\nof PAH (CPAH ) can be used to estimate the renal plasma \\nflow, as follows:\\nCPAH = (UPAH × V)/PPAH ≅ Renal plasma ﬂow\\nwhere UPAH and P PAH are urine and plasma concentra-\\ntions of PAH, respectively, and V is the urine flow rate.\\nThe filtration fraction is the GFR/renal plasma flow \\nratio. If renal plasma flow is 650 ml/min and the GFR is \\n125 ml/min, the filtration fraction is 125/650, or 0.19.\\nTubular Reabsorption or Secretion Can Be Calculated \\nFrom Renal Clearances . For substances that are \\ncompletely reabsorbed from the tubules (e.g., amino \\nacids and glucose), the clearance rate is zero because \\nthe urinary secretion rate is zero. For substances that \\nare highly reabsorbed (e.g., sodium), the clearance rate \\nis usually less than 1 percent of the GFR, or less than 1 \\nml/min. In general, waste products of metabolism, such \\nas urea, are poorly reabsorbed and have relatively high \\nclearance rates.\\nThe tubular reabsorption rate is calculated as the differ -\\nence between the rate of filtration of the substance (GFR \\n× PX ) and the urinary excretion rate (U X  × V), as follows:\\nReabsorptionX = (GFR ×PX) −(UX ×V)\\nIf the excretion rate of a substance is greater than \\nthe filtered load, the rate at which it appears in the urine \\nrepresents the sum of the rate of glomerular filtration \\nplus tubular secretion; the secretion rate is therefore \\nthe difference between the rate of urinary excretion of a \\nsubstance and the rate at which it is filtered, as follows:\\nSecretionX = (UX × V) −(GFR×PX)'),\n",

All \\nof these mechanisms together play an important role \\nin the rapid restitution of the blood volume that occurs \\nduring acute conditions associated with reduced blood \\nvolume, low arterial pressure, or both.\\nReflex decreases in renal sympathetic activity may \\ncontribute to rapid elimination of excess fluid in the \\ncirculation after ingestion of a meal that contains large \\namounts of salt and water.\\nAngiotensin II Is a Powerful Controller of Renal Excretion. \\nWhen sodium intake is increased above normal, renin se-\\ncretion decreases and causes reduced angiotensin II for-\\nmation. Reduced angiotensin II levels have several effects \\non the kidney that decrease tubular sodium reabsorption \\n(see Chapter 28). Conversely, when sodium intake is re-\\nduced, increased levels of angiotensin cause sodium and \\nwater retention and oppose decreases in arterial pressure \\nthat would otherwise occur. Changes in the activity of \\nthe renin-angiotensin system act as a powerful amplifier \\nof the pressure natriuresis mechanism for maintaining \\nstable blood pressure and body fluid volumes.\\nAlthough angiotensin II is one of the most power -\\nful sodium- and water-retaining hormones in the body, \\nneither a decrease nor an increase in circulating angio-\\ntensin II has a large effect on extracellular fluid volume \\nor blood volume in persons with an otherwise normal \\ncardiovascular system. The reason for this is that with \\nlarge increases in angiotensin II levels, such as occurs \\nwith a renin-secreting tumor in the kidney, there is only \\ntransient sodium and water retention, which elevates \\nthe arterial pressure. This elevation quickly increases \\nkidney output of sodium and water, thereby overcom-\\ning the sodium-retaining effects of angiotensin II and \\nre-establishing a balance between intake and output of \\nsodium at a higher arterial pressure.\\nConversely, blockade of angiotensin II formation with \\ndrugs, such as converting enzyme inhibitors and angio -\\ntensin II antagonists, greatly increases the ability of the \\nkidneys to excrete salt and water but does not cause a \\nmajor change in extracellular fluid volume. After block-\\nade of angiotensin II, a transient increase in sodium and \\nwater excretion occurs that reduces the arterial pressure, \\nthus helping re-establish the sodium balance. This effect \\nof angiotensin II blockers has proved to be important for \\nlowering blood pressure in hypertensive patients.\\nAldosterone Has a Major Role in Controlling Renal \\nSodium Excretion. The function of aldosterone in regulating \\nsodium balance is closely related to that described for '),\n",

Conversely, with \\nhigh sodium intake, suppression of aldosterone formation \\ndecreases tubular sodium reabsorption, allowing the \\nkidneys to excrete large amounts of sodium. Changes in \\naldosterone formation also help the pressure natriuresis \\nmechanism maintain sodium balance during variations in \\nsodium intake.\\nHowever, when excess aldosterone formation occurs, \\nsuch as in patients with tumors of the adrenal gland, the \\nincreased sodium reabsorption and decreased sodium \\nexcretion usually last only a few days, and the extracellu-\\nlar fluid volume increases by only about 10 to 15 percent, \\ncausing increased arterial pressure. When the arterial \\npressure rises sufficiently, the kidneys “escape” from \\nsodium and water retention (because of pressure natriure-\\nsis) and thereafter excrete amounts of sodium equal to the \\ndaily intake, despite continued high levels of aldosterone.\\nAntidiuretic Hormone Controls Renal Water Excretion . \\nAs explained previously, ADH plays an important role in \\nallowing the kidneys to form a small volume of concentrated \\nurine while excreting normal amounts of sodium. This \\neffect is especially important during water deprivation. \\nConversely, when there is excess extracellular fluid volume, \\ndecreased ADH levels reduce reabsorption of water by the \\nkidneys and help rid the body of excess volume.\\nExcessive levels of ADH, however, rarely cause large \\nincreases in arterial pressure or extracellular fluid vol -\\nume. Infusion of large amounts of ADH into animals ini-\\ntially increases extracellular fluid volume by only 10 to 15 \\npercent. As the arterial pressure rises in response to this \\nincreased volume, much of the excess volume is excreted \\nbecause of pressure diuresis; after several days, the blood \\nvolume and extracellular fluid volume are elevated by no \\nmore than 5 to 10 percent, and the arterial pressure is \\nelevated by less than 10 mm Hg. High levels of ADH do \\nnot cause major increases in body fluid volume or arte-\\nrial pressure, although high ADH levels can cause severe \\nreductions in the extracellular sodium ion concentration.\\nINTEGRATED RESPONSES TO CHANGES IN \\nSODIUM INTAKE (p. 405)\\nIntegration of the various control systems that regu -\\nlate sodium and fluid excretion can be summarized by \\nexamining the homeostatic responses to increases in \\ndietary sodium intake.

It is mainly the small increase \\nin extracellular fluid volume that triggers various mech-\\nanisms in the body to increase the amount of sodium \\nexcretion. These mechanisms are as follows:\\n •  Activation of low-pressure receptor reflexes that orig-\\ninate from the stretch receptors of the right atrium \\nand pulmonary blood vessels. These reflexes inhibit \\nsympathetic activity and angiotensin II formation, \\nboth of which tend to decrease tubular sodium  \\nreabsorption.\\n •  Increased secretion from the cardiac atria of atrial \\nnatriuretic peptide, which reduces renal tubular so-\\ndium reabsorption.\\n •  Suppression of angiotensin II formation,  caused by \\nincreases in arterial pressure and extracellular vol -\\nume, decreases tubular sodium reabsorption by \\neliminating the normal effect of angiotensin II to in-\\ncrease sodium reabsorption. In addition, decreased \\nlevels of angiotensin II reduce aldosterone secretion, \\nfurther reducing sodium reabsorption.\\n •  A small increase in arterial pressure  promotes so -\\ndium excretion through pressure natriuresis. If the \\nnervous, hormonal, and intrarenal mechanisms are \\noperating effectively, measurable increases in blood \\npressure may not occur even with large increases in \\nsodium intake.\\nThe combined activation of natriuretic systems and \\nsuppression of sodium- and water-retaining systems \\nleads to increased excretion of sodium when sodium \\nintake is increased.

Almost all of \\nthese conditions result from circulatory abnormalities, \\nincluding the following:\\n •  Heart diseases.

If the heart is greatly weakened, however, \\narterial pressure cannot increase sufficiently to re-\\nstore urine output to normal. When this occurs, the \\nkidneys retain fluid until severe circulatory con-\\ngestion develops and the person eventually dies of \\nedema, especially pulmonary edema.\\n •  Increased capacity of the circulation. Any condition \\nthat increases vascular capacity also causes the blood \\nvolume to increase and fill this extra capacity. Exam-\\nples of conditions associated with increased vascular \\ncapacity include pregnancy (resulting from increased \\nvascular capacity of the uterus, placenta, and other \\nenlarged organs) and varicose veins, which in severe \\ncases may hold as much as an extra liter of blood.\\nCONDITIONS THAT CAUSE LARGE INCREASES \\nIN EXTRACELLULAR FLUID VOLUME BUT WITH \\nNORMAL BLOOD VOLUME (p. 406)\\nIn several pathophysiological conditions, the extra-\\ncellular fluid volume becomes markedly increased \\nbut blood volume remains normal or even slightly \\ndecreased. These conditions are usually initiated by \\nleakage of fluid and protein into the interstitium, which \\ntends to decrease blood volume. The kidneys’ response \\nto these conditions is similar to the response after \\nhemorrhage—the kidneys retain salt and water in an \\nattempt to restore normal blood volume. Two examples \\nare as follows:\\n •  Nephrotic syndrome, characterized by a loss of plas -\\nma proteins in urine, reduces the plasma colloid os -\\nmotic pressure and causes the capillaries throughout \\nthe body to filter large amounts of fluid, in turn caus-\\ning edema and decreased plasma volume.\\n •  Liver cirrhosis associated with decreased synthesis of \\nplasma proteins by the liver. A sequence of events \\nthat occurs during liver cirrhosis is similar to that \\nseen with nephrotic syndrome, except that with cir-\\nrhosis, the decreased plasma protein concentration \\nresults from destruction of the liver cells, rendering \\nthem unable to synthesize enough plasma proteins. \\nCirrhosis is also associated with fibrous tissue in \\nliver structures, which greatly impedes the flow of \\nportal blood through the liver.

This results in an excess of \\nH+  in the renal tubules, causing complete reabsorption \\nof HCO 3 −  and leaving still additional H +  available to \\ncombine with the urinary buffers NH 4 +  and HPO 4 2− . In \\nacidosis, the kidneys reabsorb all of the filtered HCO 3 −  \\nand contribute new HCO 3 −  through the formation of \\nNH 4 +  and titratable acid.\\nMetabolic Acidosis Results From Decreased Bicarbonate \\nin Extracellular Fluids. The decreased extracellular fluid \\nHCO 3 −  concentration causes a decrease in glomerular \\nfiltration of HCO 3 − . The compensatory responses \\ninclude stimulation of respiration, which eliminates \\nCO2  and returns the pH toward normal. At the same \\ntime, renal compensation increases reabsorption of \\nHCO3 −  and excretion of titratable acid and NH 4 + , which \\nleads to formation of new HCO 3 −  and return of pH \\ntoward normal.\\nSome of the primary causes of metabolic acidosis are \\nas follows:\\n •  Decreased renal tubular secretion of H+  or decreased \\nreabsorption of HCO3− . This can occur as a result of \\na condition called renal tubular acidosis, in which the \\nkidneys are unable to secrete adequate amounts of \\nH+ . As a result, large amounts of HCO 3 −  are lost in the \\nurine, causing a continued state of metabolic acido -\\nsis. Chronic renal failure, which occurs when kidney \\nfunction declines markedly and H +  is not adequately \\nsecreted by the tubules, also causes buildup of acids in \\nbody fluids.\\n •  Formation of excess metabolic acids in the body. An \\nexample is the metabolic acidosis that occurs with \\ndiabetes mellitus in which large amounts of aceto-\\nacetic acid are formed from metabolism of fats.\\n •  Ingestion of excess metabolic acids. This can occur, \\nfor example, with ingestion of certain drugs, such \\nas acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) and methyl alcohol, \\nwhich are metabolized to produce formic acid.\\n •  Excessive loss of base from the body fluids.

The excess H + \\nremaining in the tubular cells combines with buffers, \\nespecially ammonia, which leads to generation of \\nnew HCO3−, which is added back to the blood. These \\nchanges help return plasma pH toward normal.\\nCommon causes of respiratory acidosis are patho -\\nlogical conditions that damage the respiratory centers or \\nthe ability of the lungs to eliminate CO2 effectively. For \\nexample, damage to the respiratory center in the medulla \\noblongata can cause respiratory acidosis. Obstruction \\nof the passages of the respiratory tract, pneumonia, \\ndecreased pulmonary surface area, or any factor that \\ninterferes with the exchange of gases between the blood \\nand alveolar membrane can cause respiratory acidosis.\\nRENAL CORRECTION OF ALKALOSIS—\\nDECREASED TUBULAR SECRETION OF H+  \\nAND INCREASED EXCRETION OF HCO3− (p. 422)\\nAlkalosis occurs when the arterial pH rises above 7.4. \\nIf the increase in pH results mainly from an increase in \\nplasma HCO3−, it is called metabolic alkalosis, whereas \\nalkalosis caused by a decrease in Pco 2 is called respira-\\ntory alkalosis.\\nThe compensatory responses to alkalosis are basi -\\ncally opposite those of acidosis. With alkalosis, the \\nHCO3−/CO2 ratio in the extracellular fluid increases, \\ncausing an increase in pH (a decrease in H + concentra-\\ntion). Regardless of whether the alkalosis is caused by \\nmetabolic or respiratory abnormalities, an increase in \\nthe HCO3−/H+ ratio in renal tubular fluid still occurs. \\nThe net effect is an excess of HCO 3− that cannot be \\nreabsorbed from the tubules and therefore is excreted \\nin the urine. With alkalosis, HCO3− is removed from the \\nextracellular fluid through renal excretion, which has \\nthe same effect as adding H+ to the extracellular fluid.\\nMetabolic Alkalosis Results From Increased HCO 3 − in \\nExtracellular Fluid.  Increased HCO3− in extracellular fluid \\ncauses an increase in filtered load of HCO 3−, which in \\nturn results in excess HCO3− over H+ in the renal tubu-\\nlar fluid. The excess HCO3− in the tubular fluid fails to be \\nreabsorbed because it does not have sufficient H + with \\nwhich to react and therefore is excreted in the urine. \\nWith metabolic alkalosis, the primary compensations \\nare increased renal excretion of HCO3− and a decreased \\nventilation rate, which increases the Pco2.'),\n",

In this chapter, we discuss physiological abnor-\\nmalities that occur in a few of the most important types \\nof kidney diseases.\\nDiseases of the kidneys are among the most \\nimportant causes of death and disability in many \\ncountries throughout the world. For example, in \\n2014, more than 26 million adults in the United States \\nwere estimated to have CKD, and many more millions \\nof people to have AKI or less severe forms of kidney \\ndysfunction.\\nAcute Kidney Injury (p. 429)\\nThree main categories of AKI have been identified.\\nPrerenal AKI Is Caused by Decreased Blood Supply to \\nthe Kidneys. Decreased blood supply to the kidneys can \\nbe a consequence of heart failure, which reduces cardiac \\noutput and blood pressure, or conditions associated \\nwith diminished blood volume, such as severe \\nhemorrhage. When blood flow to the kidney decreases \\nto less than 20 percent of the normal rate, the renal cells \\nstart to become hypoxic. Further decreases in flow, if \\nprolonged, cause damage or death to the renal cells. If \\nthe AKI is not corrected, this type of failure can evolve \\ninto intrarenal AKI.\\nIntrarenal AKI Results From Abnormalities in the Kidney \\nItself, Including Abnormalities That Affect the Blood Vessels, \\nGlomeruli, or Tubules . Acute glomerulonephritis is a type \\nof intrarenal AKI caused by an abnormal immune \\nreaction that causes inflammation of the glomeruli. \\nThe acute inflammation usually subsides within about 2 \\nweeks, although in some patients many of the glomeruli \\nare destroyed beyond repair. In a small percentage \\nof patients, continued renal deterioration leads to \\nprogressive CKD.\\nOther causes of intrarenal AKI include acute tubu-\\nlar necrosis, which is caused by severe renal ischemia or \\ntoxins and medications that damage the tubular epithe-\\nlial cells. If the damage is not too severe, some regenera-\\ntion of the tubular epithelial cells can occur, and renal \\nfunction can be restored.\\nPostrenal AKI Is Caused by Obstruction of the Urinary \\nCollecting System Anywhere From the Calyces to the Outflow \\nFrom the Bladder.

The maintenance of normal \\nplasma concentrations of electrolytes and normal body \\nfluid volumes occurs at the expense of systemic com-\\npensations, such as hypertension, which over the long \\nterm can lead to additional clinical problems.\\nCKD, like AKI, can occur because of disorders of the \\nblood vessels, glomeruli, tubules, renal interstitium, and \\nlower urinary tract. Despite the wide variety of diseases \\nthat can cause CKD, the end result is essentially the \\nsame—a decrease in the number of functional nephrons.\\nChronic Kidney Disease May Initiate a Vicious Circle That \\nLeads to End-Stage Renal Disease . In some cases, an initial \\ninsult to the kidney leads to progressive deterioration of \\nrenal function and further loss of nephrons to the point at \\nwhich to survive, a person must receive dialysis treatment \\nor undergo transplantation with a functional kidney. This \\ncondition is referred to as end-stage renal disease.\\nThe causes of this progressive injury are not known, \\nbut some investigators believe that the injury may be \\nrelated in part to increased pressure or stretch in the \\nremaining glomeruli that results from adaptive vasodi-\\nlatation or increased blood pressure. It is believed that \\nthe increased pressure and stretch of arterioles and \\nglomeruli eventually cause sclerosis (i.e., replacement \\nof normal tissue with fibrous tissue) of these vessels. \\nThese sclerotic lesions eventually obliterate the glom -\\nerulus, leading to further reduction in kidney function \\nand a slowly progressing vicious circle that terminates \\nin end-stage renal disease. Among the most common \\ncauses of end-stage renal disease are diabetes mellitus \\nand hypertension, which together account for more than \\n70 percent of all cases of CKD.\\nSome of the general causes of CKD are as follows:\\n •  Injured renal blood vessels. Some of the most com-\\nmon causes of renal vascular injury are atherosclerosis \\nof the large renal arteries, fibromuscular hyperplasia \\nof one or more of the large arteries, and nephroscler-\\nosis, a condition caused by sclerotic lesions of the \\nsmaller vessels and glomeruli that is often a result of \\nhypertension or diabetes mellitus.'),\n",

One example is chronic glomeru-\\nlonephritis, which can be the result of several dis -\\neases that cause inflammation and damage to the \\nglomerular capillaries. In contrast to the acute form \\nof this disease, chronic glomerulonephritis is a slow-\\nly progressive disease that may lead to irreversible \\nkidney failure. It may be a primary kidney disease, \\noccurring after acute glomerulonephritis, or it may \\nbe secondary to a systemic disease, such as lupus \\nerythematosus.\\n •  Injured renal interstitium. Primary or secondary dis-\\nease of the renal interstitium is referred to as inter-\\nstitial nephritis. This disease can result from vascular, \\nglomerular, or tubular damage that destroys individual \\nnephrons, or it can involve primary damage to the re-\\nnal interstitium caused by poisons, drugs, or bacterial \\ninfections. Renal interstitial injury caused by bacterial \\ninfection is called pyelonephritis. This infection can re-\\nsult from bacteria that reach the kidneys through the \\nbloodstream or, more commonly, ascension from the \\nlower urinary tract through the ureters to the kidney. \\nWith long-standing pyelonephritis, invasion of the \\nkidneys by bacteria not only causes damage to the re-\\nnal interstitium but also results in progressive damage \\nto the renal tubules, glomeruli, and other structures, \\neventually leading to loss of functional nephrons.\\nNephron Function in Chronic Kidney Disease (p. 435)\\nLoss of Functional Nephrons Requires Surviving Nephrons \\nto Excrete More Water and Solutes . The kidneys normally \\nfilter about 180 liters of fluid each day at the glomerular \\ncapillaries and then transform this filtrate to approximately \\n1.5 liters of urine as the fluid flows along successive \\nnephron segments. Regardless of the number of functional \\nnephrons, the kidneys must excrete the same volume of \\nurine (if intake is constant) to maintain fluid balance. The \\nloss of functional nephrons therefore requires the surviving \\nnephrons to excrete extra amounts of water and solutes \\nto prevent serious accumulation of these substances in \\nthe body fluids. This is achieved by increasing the GFR or \\ndecreasing the tubular reabsorption rate in the surviving \\nnephrons. These adaptations allow water and electrolyte \\nbalances to be maintained with little change in extracellular \\nvolume or electrolyte composition, even in patients who \\nhave lost as much as 70 percent of their nephrons.\\nIn contrast to the electrolytes, many waste products \\nof metabolism, such as urea and creatinine, accumulate \\nalmost in proportion to the number of nephrons that '),\n",

Assuming that intake remains \\nrelatively constant, the following important effects of \\nrenal failure occur:\\n •  W ater is retained and edema develops.\\n •  Inc reases in extracellular fluid urea (uremia) and \\nother nonprotein nitrogens (azotemia) occur. The \\nnonprotein nitrogens include urea, uric acid, cre-\\natinine, and a few less important compounds. These \\nsubstances, in general, are the end products of pro-\\ntein metabolism.\\n •  A cidosis results from failure of the kidneys to rid the \\nbody of normal acidic products. The buffers of the \\nbody fluids can normally buffer 500 to 1000 milli-\\nmoles of acid without lethal increases in the extracel-\\nlular H+ concentration. Each day, however, the body \\nnormally produces about 50 to 80 millimoles more \\nmetabolic acid than metabolic alkali. Complete renal \\nfailure therefore leads to severe accumulation of acid \\nin the blood within a few days.\\n •  Anemia occurs because if the kidneys are seriously \\ndamaged, they are unable to form adequate amounts of \\nerythropoietin, which stimulates bone marrow to pro-\\nduce red blood cells.\\n •  Ost eomalacia occurs because with prolonged kidney \\nfailure, inadequate amounts of the active form of vi-\\ntamin D are produced, causing decreased intestinal \\nabsorption of calcium and decreased availability of \\ncalcium to the bones. These conditions lead to osteo-\\nmalacia, in which the bones are partially resorbed and \\nbecome greatly weakened. Another important cause \\nof demineralization of the bones in chronic renal fail-\\nure is the rise in serum phosphate concentration that \\noccurs because of the decreased GFR. The higher se-\\nrum phosphate level increases binding of phosphate \\nwith calcium in the plasma, decreasing the serum \\nionized calcium, which in turn stimulates parathyroid \\nhormone secretion, increasing the release of calcium \\nfrom bones and further demineralization.'),\n",

Normal RBCs are biconcave disks, although \\nthe shapes can change markedly as the cells pass through \\nthe capillaries. A normal RBC has a great excess of cell \\nmembrane relative to the quantity of material it contains. \\nDeformation of the cell does not stretch the membrane \\nand consequently does not rupture the cell.

All circulating blood cells \\nare derived from pluripotential hematopoietic stem \\ncells. The pluripotential cells differentiate to form \\nthe peripheral blood cells.

The early offspring of the stem cells \\ncannot be recognized as different types of blood cells \\neven though they already have been committed to a \\nparticular cell line; these cells are called committed stem \\ncells. Different committed stem cells produce different \\ncolonies of specific types of blood cells.\\nThe growth and reproduction of the various stem cells \\nare controlled by multiple proteins called growth induc-\\ners, which promote growth, but not differentiation, of \\nthe cells. Differentiation is the function of another set \\nof proteins, called differentiation inducers. Each of these \\ninducers causes one type of stem cell to differentiate one \\nor more steps toward the final type of adult blood cell. The \\nformation of growth inducers and differentiation inducers \\nis controlled by factors outside the bone marrow.

Both vitamin B 12 and folic acid are essential \\nto the synthesis of DNA. The lack of either of these \\nvitamins results in a diminished quantity of DNA and, \\nconsequently, failure of nuclear maturation and division. \\nIn addition to failure to proliferate, the RBCs become \\nlarger than normal, developing into megaloblasts.

The oxygen atom binds loosely with one of the \\nso-called coordination bonds of the iron atom in hemo-\\nglobin. When bound to the iron heme, oxygen is carried \\nas molecular oxygen, composed of two oxygen atoms. '),\n",

About 65 percent of this amount is in the \\nform of hemoglobin. About 4 percent is in the form of \\nmyoglobin, 1 percent is in the form of the various heme \\ncompounds that promote intracellular oxidation, 0.1 \\npercent is combined with the protein transferrin in the \\nblood plasma, and 15 to 30 percent is stored mainly in \\nthe reticuloendothelial system and liver parenchymal \\ncells, principally in the form of ferritin.\\nIron Is Transported and Stored. When iron is absorbed \\nfrom the small intestine it almost immediately combines \\nwith a β-globulin called apotransferrin to form \\ntransferrin, which is transported in the plasma. This iron \\nis loosely bound. Excess iron in the blood is deposited \\nin liver hepatocytes and in reticuloendothelial cells of \\nthe bone marrow. Once inside the cell’s cytoplasm, iron \\ncombines with the protein apoferritin to form ferritin. \\nVarying quantities of iron can combine in clusters of \\niron radicals in the ferritin.\\nWhen the quantity of iron in the plasma decreases \\nto less than normal, iron is removed from ferritin quite \\neasily and transported by transferrin in the plasma to the \\nportions of the body where it is needed. A unique char-\\nacteristic of the transferrin molecule is its ability to bind \\nstrongly with receptors in the cell membranes of the \\nerythroblasts and bone marrow. Transferrin is ingested \\nvia endocytosis into the erythroblasts along with the \\nbound iron. Transferrin delivers the iron directly to the \\nmitochondria, where heme is synthesized.\\nWhen RBCs have reached the end of their life span \\nand are destroyed, the hemoglobin released is ingested \\nby cells of the monocyte-macrophage system. The free \\niron that is liberated can be stored in the ferritin pool or \\nreused for formation of hemoglobin.\\nANEMIAS (p. 452)\\nAnemia means a deficiency of RBCs and can be caused \\nby rapid loss of RBCs or slow production of RBCs.\\n •  Blood loss anemia occurs after significant hemor -\\nrhage.

After significant hemorrhage, a period of \\n3 to 4 weeks is required for the number of RBCs to \\nreturn to normal levels.\\n •  Aplastic anemia is the result of nonfunctioning bone \\nmarrow, which may be due to exposure to gamma \\nradiation for cancer treatment or toxic chemicals \\nsuch as insecticides or benzene in gasoline. Autoim-\\nmune disorders such as lupus erythematosus result \\nin an immune system attack on the healthy cells of \\nthe bone marrow, which destroys stem cells and \\nmay lead to aplastic anemia. Individuals with severe \\naplastic anemia usually die unless they are treated \\nwith blood transfusions or bone marrow transplants.\\n •  Megaloblastic anemia is the result of a lack of vi -\\ntamin B 12, folic acid, or intrinsic factor. Lack of \\nthese substances leads to slow reproduction of the \\nerythrocytes in the bone marrow. As a result, these \\nerythrocytes grow into large, odd-shaped cells called \\nmegaloblasts.\\n •  Hemolytic anemia is the result of fragile RBCs that \\nrupture as they pass through the capillaries. With \\nhemolytic anemia, the number of RBCs that form \\nis normal or in excess of normal; however, because \\nthese cells are extremely fragile, their life span is \\nvery short. Sickle cell anemia is a type of hemolytic \\nanemia caused by an abnormal composition of the \\nglobin chains of hemoglobin. When this abnormal \\nhemoglobin is exposed to low concentrations of oxy-\\ngen, it precipitates into long crystals inside the RBC, \\nwhich causes the cell to have an abnormal sickle \\nshape and to be extremely fragile.\\nPOLYCYTHEMIA (p. 453)\\nPolycythemia is a condition in which the number of \\nRBCs in the circulation increases hypoxia or genetic \\naberration. Individuals who live at high altitudes have \\nphysiologic polycythemia as a result of the thin atmo-\\nsphere. Polycythemia can also occur in individuals with \\ncardiac failure because of decreased delivery of oxygen \\nto the tissues.\\nPolycythemia vera is a genetic aberration in the hemo-\\ncytoblastic cell line. The blast cells continue to produce \\nRBCs even though too many blood cells are present in the \\ncirculation. The hematocrit can rise to 60 to 70 percent.\\nBecause polycythemia greatly increases the viscos -\\nity of the blood, blood flow through the vessels is often \\nsluggish.'),\n",

The leukocytes (white blood cells) are \\nthe mobile units of the protective system of the body. \\nThey are formed in bone marrow and lymph tissue and \\ntransported in the blood to areas of inflammation to \\nprovide a rapid and potent defense against infectious \\nagents. Five types of leukocytes are normally found in \\nthe blood. The normal percentages of these cells are as \\nfollows:\\n •  Polymorphonuclear neutrophils—62.0 percent\\n •  Polymorphonuclear eosinophils—2.3 percent\\n •  Polymorphonuclear basophils—0.4 percent\\n •  Monocytes—5.3 percent\\n •  Lymphocytes—30.0 percent\\nThe three types of polymorphonuclear cells have \\na granular appearance and are called granulocytes, or \\n“ p o l y s .” The granulocytes and monocytes protect the \\nbody against invading organisms by ingesting them via \\nthe process of phagocytosis.

Two lineages of white \\nblood cells are formed from pluripotential hematopoietic \\nstem cells: the myelocytic lineage and the lymphocytic \\nlineage. Granulocytes and monocytes are the products \\nof the myelocytic lineage, whereas lymphocytes are the \\nproducts of the lymphocytic lineage.\\nThe Life Span of White Blood Cells Varies.

The \\nlife span of granulocytes released from bone marrow is \\nnormally 4 to 5 hours in the circulating blood and an \\nadditional 4 to 5 days in the tissues. When serious tissue \\ninfection is present, the total life span is often shortened \\nto only a few hours because the granulocytes proceed \\nrapidly to the infected area, perform their function, and \\nare destroyed in the process.\\nThe monocytes also have a short transit time of \\n10 to 12 hours before they enter the tissues.

They can live in this form for months \\nunless they are destroyed while performing phagocytic \\nfunctions.\\nLymphocytes enter the circulatory system continu-\\nously along with the drainage of lymph from the lymph \\nnodes. After a few hours, they pass back into the tissue \\nvia diapedesis and re-enter the lymph to return to the \\nblood again and again; thus lymphocytes are continu-\\nously circulating throughout the tissue. The lympho -\\ncytes have a life span of months or even years depending \\non the need of the body for these cells.\\nNEUTROPHILS AND MACROPHAGES DEFEND \\nAGAINST INFECTIONS (p. 457)\\nIt is mainly neutrophils and monocytes that attack and \\ndestroy invading bacteria, viruses, and other injurious \\nagents. Neutrophils are mature cells that can attack and \\ndestroy bacteria and viruses in the circulating blood. \\nBlood monocytes are immature cells that have little \\nability to fight infectious agents. However, once they \\nenter the tissue, they mature into tissue macrophages \\nthat are extremely capable of combating disease agents. \\nBoth the neutrophils and macrophages move through \\nthe tissues via ameboid motion when stimulated by \\nproducts formed in inflamed areas. This attraction of \\nthe neutrophils and macrophages to the inflamed area \\nis called chemotaxis.\\nA Major Function of Neutrophils and Macrophages Is \\nPhagocytosis. Phagocytosis must be a highly selective \\nprocess; otherwise, normal cells and structures \\nwould be ingested. Certain physical characteristics \\nincrease the chance for phagocytosis. Most natural \\nstructures in the tissue have smooth surfaces that \\nresist phagocytosis, but if the surface is rough, the \\nlikelihood of phagocytosis is increased. Most naturally \\noccurring substances in the body have protective \\nprotein coats that repel phagocytes. Dead tissues \\nand most foreign particles often have no protective \\ncoat, which makes them subject to phagocytosis. The \\nbody also has specific means of recognizing certain \\nforeign materials to which antibodies adhere; the \\nbinding of antibodies to foreign particles enhances \\nphagocytosis.\\nOnce a foreign particle has been phagocytized, \\nlysosomes and other cytoplasmic granules immedi -\\nately come in contact with the phagocytic vesicles and \\ndump digestive enzymes and bactericidal agents into \\nthe vesicle.'),\n",

The \\ntissue spaces and lymphatics in the inflamed area are \\nblocked by fibrinogen clots, so fluid barely flows through \\nthese spaces. This process delays spread of bacteria or \\ntoxic products. The intensity of the inflammatory pro-\\ncess is usually proportional to the degree of tissue injury. \\nStaphylococci that invade the tissue liberate lethal cel -\\nlular toxins, which is followed by rapid development of \\ninflammation. Characteristically, staphylococcal infec -\\ntions are walled off rapidly. By comparison, streptococci \\ndo not cause such intense local tissue destruction, so \\nthe walling off develops slowly. As a result, streptococci \\nhave a far greater tendency to spread through the body \\nand cause death than do staphylococci, even though \\nstaphylococci are far more destructive to the tissues.\\nMacrophage and Neutrophil Responses During \\nInflammation (p. 460)\\nTissue Macrophages Are the First Line of Defense Against \\nInvading Organisms. Within minutes after inflammation \\nbegins, macrophages present in the tissues begin their \\nphagocytic actions. Many sessile macrophages break \\nloose from their attachments and become mobile in \\nresponse to chemotactic factors. These macrophages \\nmigrate to the area of inflammation and contribute their \\nactivity.\\nNeutrophil Invasion of the Inflamed Tissue Is a Second \\nLine of Defense. During the first hour or so after \\ninflammation begins, large numbers of neutrophils \\ninvade the inflamed area as a result of products in \\nthe inflamed tissue that attract these cells and cause \\nchemotaxis toward that area.\\nWithin a few hours after the onset of severe acute \\ninflammation, the number of neutrophils increases by as \\nmany as four- to fivefold.

This process results in more neutrophils being \\nmade available to the inflamed tissue area.\\nA Second Macrophage Invasion of the Inflamed Tissue \\nIs the Third Line of Defense . Along with invasion of \\nneutrophils, monocytes from blood enter the inflamed \\ntissue and enlarge to become macrophages. The \\nnumber of monocytes in circulating blood is low, and \\nthe storage pool of monocytes in the bone marrow is \\nmuch less than that of the neutrophils. The buildup of \\nmacrophages in inflamed tissue is much slower than \\nthat of neutrophils. After several days to several weeks, \\nmacrophages become the dominant phagocytic cell in \\nthe inflamed area because of increased bone marrow \\nproduction of monocytes.\\nThe Fourth Line of Defense is Greatly Increased Produc -\\ntion of Granulocytes and Monocytes by Bone Marrow . This \\nprocess results from stimulation of the granulocytic and \\nmonocytic progenitor cells of the marrow. It takes 3 to  \\n4 days for the newly formed granulocytes and monocytes \\nto reach the stage of leaving the marrow area.\\nMany Factors Are Involved in Feedback Control of \\nMacrophage and Neutrophil Responses. More than two \\ndozen factors have been implicated in controlling \\nmacrophage-neutrophil responses to inflammation. The \\nfollowing five factors are thought to play a dominant \\nrole:\\n 1.  Tumor necrosis factor\\n 2.  Interleukin-1\\n 3.  Granulocyte-monocyte colony-stimulating factor\\n 4.  Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor\\n 5.  Monocyte colony-stimulating factor\\nThese five factors are formed by activated macro-\\nphages and T cells in the inflamed tissues. The main \\ninstruments of the increased production of granulo-\\ncytes and monocytes by bone marrow are the three \\ncolony-stimulating factors. The combination of tumor \\nnecrosis factor, interleukin-1, and colony-stimulating \\nfactors provides a powerful feedback mechanism that \\nbegins with tissue inflammation and proceeds to forma-\\ntion of defensive white blood cells and removal of the \\ncause, as well as the inflammation.\\nFormation of Pus .

Most parasites are too large to \\nbe phagocytized. The eosinophils attach themselves \\nto the surface of the parasites and release substances \\nsuch as hydrolytic enzymes, reactive forms of oxygen, \\nand larvicidal polypeptides called major basic proteins, \\nwhich then kill many of the invading parasites.\\nThe eosinophils normally constitute about 2 percent \\nof all the blood leukocytes. In addition to combating \\nparasitic infections, eosinophils have a propensity to col-\\nlect in tissues in which allergic reactions have occurred. \\nThe migration of the eosinophils to inflamed allergic tis-\\nsue results from release of eosinophil chemotactic fac -\\ntor from mast cells and basophils. The eosinophils are \\nbelieved to detoxify some of the inflammation-inducing \\nsubstances released by mast cells and basophils and \\ndestroy allergen-antibody complexes, thus preventing \\nspread of the inflammatory process.\\nBasophils Are Circulating Mast Cells. Mast cells \\nand basophils liberate heparin into the blood, which \\nprevents blood coagulation. These cells release \\nhistamine, as well as smaller quantities of bradykinin \\nand serotonin, which contribute to the inflammation \\nprocess. The mast cells and basophils play an important \\nrole in some allergic reactions. The immunoglobulin \\nE class of antibodies (those responsible for allergic \\nreactions) has a propensity to become attached to \\nmast cells and basophils. The resulting attachment of \\nthe allergic antigen to the immunoglobulin E antibody \\ncauses mast cells or basophils to rupture and release \\nlarge quantities of histamine, bradykinin, serotonin, \\nheparin, slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis, and \\nlysosomal enzymes.

Most organisms have \\ninnate immunity, which consists of general actions such \\nas phagocytosis of bacteria, destruction of pathogens by \\nacidic secretions, digestive enzymes in the gastrointes\\xad\\ntinal tract, resistance of the skin to invasion, and certain \\nchemicals in the blood that attach to foreign organisms \\nor toxins and destroy them. Acquired immunity is the \\nability to develop powerful protective mechanisms \\nagainst specific invading agents such as lethal bacte\\xad\\nria, viruses, toxins, and even foreign tissues from other \\norganisms.\\nAcquired Immunity Is Initiated by Antigens. Two basic \\ntypes of acquired immunity occur in the body. Humoral \\nimmunity, or B-cell immunity, involves the development \\nof circulating antibodies that are capable of attacking \\nan invading agent. Cell-mediated immunity, or T-cell \\nimmunity, is achieved through the formation of large \\nnumbers of activated lymphocytes that are specifically \\ndesigned to destroy the foreign agent.\\nBecause acquired immunity does not occur until \\nafter invasion by a foreign organism or toxin, the body \\nmust have some mechanism for recognizing the inva\\xad\\nsion. Each invading organism or toxin usually contains \\none or more specific chemical compounds that are dif\\xad\\nferent from all other compounds. These compounds are \\ncalled antigens, and they initiate the development of \\nacquired immunity.\\nFor a substance such as a polypeptide to be anti\\xad\\ngenic, it usually must have a molecular weight of at \\nleast 8000 kilodaltons. However, immune responses \\ncan also be generated against smaller substances called \\nhaptens if they are attached to a large carrier such as \\na protein. The process of antigenicity depends on the \\nregular occurrence on the surface of the large molecules \\nof molecular groups called epitopes; proteins and large \\npolysaccharides are almost always antigenic because \\nthey contain this type of stereochemical characteristic.\\nLymphocytes Are Responsible for Acquired Immunity. \\nLymphocytes are found in lymph nodes and in special \\nlymphoid tissue such as the spleen, submucosal areas of \\nthe gastrointestinal tract, and bone marrow.

T lymphocytes are processed in the \\nthymus gland and are responsible for cell\\xadmediated immu\\xad\\nnity. B lymphocytes, which are processed in the liver dur\\xad\\ning mid fetal life and in the bone marrow during late fetal \\nlife and after birth, are responsible for humoral immunity.\\nThe Thymus Gland Preprocesses T Lymphocytes . \\nLymphocytes divide rapidly and develop extreme diversity \\nfor reacting against various specific antigens in the \\nthymus gland. The processed T cells leave the thymus and \\nspread to lymphoid tissues throughout the body. Most \\npreprocessing of the T lymphocytes in the thymus occurs \\nshortly before and after birth. Removal of the thymus \\ngland after this time diminishes but does not eliminate \\nthe T\\xad lymphocyte system. Removal of the thymus several \\nmonths before birth, however, prevents the development \\nof all cell\\xadmediated immunity.\\nThe Liver and Bone Marrow Preprocess B Lymphocytes . \\nMuch less is known about the details or processing \\nof B lymphocytes. In humans, B lymphocytes are \\npreprocessed in the liver during mid fetal life and in \\nbone marrow during late fetal life and after birth. B \\nlymphocytes differ from T lymphocytes in that they \\nactively secrete antibodies, which are large protein \\nmolecules capable of combining with and destroying \\nsubstances. B lymphocytes also have a greater diversity \\nthan do T lymphocytes, forming millions and perhaps \\neven billions of antibodies with different specific \\nreactivities.

The IgG class is the largest and constitutes about 75 \\npercent of the antibodies of a normal person.\\nAntibodies Act by Directly Attacking the Invader or \\nActivating the Complement System, Which Subsequently \\nDestroys the Invading Organism . Antibodies can inactivate \\nan invading agent directly in one of the following ways:\\n •  Agglutination, in which multiple large particles with \\nantigens on their surfaces, such as bacteria or red \\nblood cells, are bound together in a clump\\n •  Precipitation, in which the molecular complex of \\nsoluble antigens and antibodies becomes so large \\nthat it is rendered insoluble\\n •  Neutralization, in which the antibodies cover the \\ntoxic sites of the antigenic agent\\n •  Lysis, in which antibodies are occasionally capable of \\ncausing rupture of an invading cell by directly attack\\xad\\ning the cell membranes\\nAlthough antibodies have some direct effects in \\ndestruction of invaders, most of the protection afforded \\nby antibodies derives from the amplifying effects of the \\ncomplement system.\\nThe Complement System Is Activated by the Antigen-\\nAntibody Reaction. Complement is a collective term \\nused to describe a system of about 20 proteins \\nnormally present in the plasma that can be activated \\nby the antigen \\xadantibody reaction.

It is on the basis of the presence \\nor absence of the agglutinogens on the RBCs that blood \\nis grouped for the purpose of transfusion. When neither \\nA nor B agglutinogen is present, the blood group is type \\nO. When only the type A agglutinogen is present, the \\nblood group is type A. When only type B agglutinogen \\nis present, the blood group is type B. When both type A \\nand B agglutinogens are present, the blood group is type \\nAB (Table 36–1).\\nWhen type A agglutinogen is not present on a per -\\nson’s RBCs, antibodies known as anti-A agglutinins \\ndevelop in the plasma. When type B agglutinogen is not \\npresent on the RBCs, antibodies known as anti-B agglu-\\ntinins develop in the plasma. Type O blood contains \\nboth anti-A and anti-B agglutinins, and type A blood \\ncontains type A agglutinogens and anti-B agglutinins. \\nType B blood contains type B agglutinogens and anti-A \\nagglutinins; type AB blood contains both type A and B \\nagglutinogens but no agglutinins (Table 36–1).\\nThe agglutinins are γ-globulins of the immunoglob -\\nulin M and immunoglobulin G immunoglobulin sub-\\nclasses.

In the Rh system, spontaneous occurrence of \\nagglutinins almost never happens. Instead, the individual \\nmust first be exposed to an Rh antigen, usually through \\ntransfusion of blood or pregnancy. When RBCs contain-\\ning Rh factor are injected into a person without the fac-\\ntor, anti-Rh agglutinins develop and reach a maximum \\nconcentration within about 2 to 4 months. On multiple \\nexposures to the Rh factor, the Rh-negative person even-\\ntually becomes strongly sensitized to it. The mismatch \\nof Rh factor blood leads to agglutination and hemolysis.\\nErythroblastosis fetalis, a disease of fetuses and new-\\nborn infants, is characterized by progressive agglutina-\\ntion and subsequent phagocytosis of RBCs. In a typical \\ncase, the mother is Rh negative and the father is Rh pos-\\nitive.

The most \\nimportant antigens in graft rejection constitute a \\ncomplex called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) \\nantigens. Only six of these antigens are ever present \\non the cell surface of any one person, but more \\nthan 150 types of HLA antigens exist; this number \\nrepresents more than a trillion possible combinations. \\nAs a consequence, it is virtually impossible for two \\nindividuals, with the exception of identical twins, to \\nhave the same six HLA antigens.\\nHLA antigens are present on white blood cells and \\non the cells of tissues.

Prothrombin \\nis an unstable plasma protein that can easily split \\ninto smaller compounds, one of which is thrombin. \\nProthrombin is produced continuously by the liver. If \\nthe liver fails to produce prothrombin, within 24 hours \\nthe concentration in the plasma falls too low to provide \\nnormal blood coagulation. Vitamin K is required by the \\nliver for normal activation of prothrombin; therefore, \\neither the lack of vitamin K or the presence of liver \\ndisease prevents normal prothrombin formation and \\nresults in bleeding tendencies.\\nFibrinogen Is Converted to Fibrin and a Clot Forms . \\nFibrinogen is a high-molecular-weight protein formed \\nin the liver. Because of its large molecular size, little \\nfibrinogen normally leaks through the capillary pores \\ninto the interstitial fluid. Thrombin is an enzyme that \\nacts on the fibrinogen molecule to remove four low-\\nmolecular-weight peptides to form a molecule of fibrin \\nmonomer. The fibrin monomer polymerizes with other \\nfibrin monomer molecules to form the long fibrin \\nthreads that produce the reticulum of the clot. The \\nnewly formed fibrin reticulum is strengthened by a \\nsubstance called fibrin-stabilizing factor, which normally \\nis present in small amounts in plasma. This substance \\nis also released from platelets entrapped in the clot. \\nFibrin-stabilizing factor, an enzyme, causes covalent \\nbonding between the fibrin monomer molecules and \\nadjacent fibrin threads, thereby strengthening the fibrin \\nmeshwork.\\nDuring Initiation of Coagulation, Prothrombin Activator \\nIs Formed in Two Basic Ways. Prothrombin activator is \\nformed via (1) the extrinsic pathway, which begins with \\ntrauma to the vascular wall and surrounding tissue, and \\n(2) the intrinsic pathway, which begins in the blood. \\nBoth pathways involve a series of β-globulin plasma \\nproteins. These blood-clotting factors are proteolytic \\nenzymes that induce the successive cascading reactions \\nof the clotting process.\\n •  The extrinsic mechanism for initiating the formation \\nof prothrombin activator begins with trauma to the \\nvascular wall or extravascular tissues and occurs ac-\\ncording to the following three steps:\\n 1.   Release of tissue thromboplastin. Traumatized tis -\\nsue releases a complex of several factors called \\ntissue thromboplastin; these factors include phos-\\npholipids from the membranes of the traumatized '),\n",

Activation of factor X to form activated factor X.  \\nThe lipoprotein complex of tissue thromboplastin \\ncomplexes with blood coagulation factor VII, and \\nin the presence of tissue phospholipids and cal-\\ncium ions, acts enzymatically on factor X to form \\nactivated factor X.\\n 3.   Effect of activated factor X to form prothrombin \\nactivator. The activated factor X immediately \\nforms a complex with the tissue phospholipid \\nreleased as part of the tissue thromboplastin and \\nwith factor V; this complex is called prothrom-\\nbin activator. Within a few seconds prothrombin \\nactivator splits prothrombin to form thrombin, \\nand the clotting process proceeds as previously \\ndescribed. Activated factor X is the protease that \\ncauses splitting of prothrombin to thrombin.\\n •  The intrinsic mechanism for initiating the formation \\nof prothrombin activator begins with trauma to the \\nblood or exposure of the blood to collagen in the \\ntraumatized vascular wall. This intrinsic mechanism \\noccurs via the following cascade of reactions:\\n 1.   Activation of factor XII and release of platelet \\nphospholipids. Through trauma, factor XII is acti-\\nvated to form a proteolytic enzyme called activat-\\ned factor XII. Simultaneously, the blood trauma \\ndamages blood platelets, which causes the release \\nof platelet phospholipids containing a lipoprotein \\ncalled platelet factor III, which plays a role in sub-\\nsequent clotting reactions.\\n 2.   Activation of factor XI.  The activated factor XII \\nacts enzymatically on factor XI to activate factor \\nXI. This second step in the intrinsic pathway re-\\nquires high-molecular-weight kininogen.\\n 3.   Activation of factor IX by activated factor XI. The \\nactivated factor XI then acts enzymatically on fac-\\ntor IX to activate it.\\n 4.   Activation of factor X. The activated factor IX, act-\\ning in concert with factor VIII and with platelet \\nphospholipids and factor III from the traumatized \\nplatelets, activates factor X. When either factor \\nVIII or platelets are in short supply, this step is \\ndeficient. Factor VIII is the factor that is missing \\nin the person who has classic hemophilia. Plate -\\nlets are the clotting factor lacking in the bleeding \\ndisease called thrombocytopenia.\\n 5.   Activation of activated factor X to form prothrom-\\nbin activator.

The pro-\\nthrombin activator in turn initiates cleavage of \\nprothrombin to form thrombin, thereby setting \\ninto motion the final clotting process.\\nCalcium Ions Are Required for Blood Clotting . Except \\nfor the first two steps in the intrinsic pathway, calcium \\nions are required for promotion of all the reactions; in \\nthe absence of calcium ions, blood clotting does not \\noccur. Fortunately, calcium ion concentration rarely \\nfalls sufficiently low to affect the kinetics of blood \\nclotting significantly. When blood is removed, it can \\nbe prevented from clotting by reducing the calcium ion \\nconcentration below the threshold level for clotting. This \\ncan be accomplished through either deionization of the \\ncalcium via reaction with substances such as a citrate \\nion or precipitation of the calcium with substances such \\nas an oxalate ion.\\nPrevention of Blood Clotting in the Normal \\nVascular System—Intravascular Anticoagulants \\n(p. 489)\\nThe most important factors for prevention of clotting \\nin the normal vascular system are (1) the smoothness \\nof the endothelium, which prevents contact activation \\nof the intrinsic clotting system; (2) a layer of glycocalyx \\non the endothelium,  which repels the clotting factors \\nand platelets; and (3) a protein bound with the endo -\\nthelial membrane (called thrombomodulin), which \\nbinds thrombin. The thrombomodulin-thrombin com-\\nplex also activates a plasma protein called protein C,  \\nwhich inactivates activated factors V and VIII. When \\nthe endothelial wall is damaged, its smoothness and its \\nglycocalyx-thrombomodulin layer are lost, which acti-\\nvates factor XII and platelets and initiates the intrinsic \\npathway of clotting.\\nAgents that remove thrombin from blood, such as \\nthe fibrin threads that form during the process of clot -\\nting and an α-globulin called antithrombin III, are the \\nmost important anticoagulants in the blood. Thrombin \\nbecomes absorbed to the fibrin threads as they develop, \\nwhich prevents the spread of thrombin into the remain-\\ning blood and prevents excessive spread of the clot.

The blood also contains another factor, α2-\\nantiplasmin, which binds with plasmin and causes inac-\\ntivation; the rate of plasmin formation must rise above a \\ncertain critical level before it becomes effective.\\nCONDITIONS THAT CAUSE EXCESSIVE BLEEDING \\nIN HUMANS (p. 490)\\nExcessive bleeding can result from a deficiency of vita -\\nmin K, from hemophilia, or from thrombocytopenia \\n(platelet deficiency). Vitamin K is necessary for the \\nformation of five important clotting factors: prothrom-\\nbin, factor VII, factor IX, factor X, and protein C. In the \\nabsence of vitamin K, insufficiency of these coagulation \\nfactors can lead to a serious bleeding tendency.\\nHemophilia Is Caused by a Deficiency of Factor VIII or \\nIX and Occurs Almost Exclusively in Males. Hemophilia A, \\nor classic hemophilia, is caused by a deficiency of factor \\nVIII and accounts for about 85 percent of cases.

Its most important component is phospholipid \\ndipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine. The presence of \\nsurfactant on the alveolar surface reduces the surface \\ntension to one twelfth to one half of the surface tension \\nof a pure water surface.\\nSmaller Alveoli Have a Greater Tendency to Collapse. \\nNote from the following equation (the law of Laplace) \\nthat the collapse pressure generated in the alveoli is \\ninversely related to the radius of the alveolus, which \\nmeans that smaller alveoli have a greater tendency to \\ncollapse:\\nPressure = (2 × Surface tension)/Radius\\nSurfactant, “Interdependence,” and Fibrous Tissue Help \\nStabilize the Size of the Alveoli . If some of the alveoli were \\nsmall and others were large, theoretically the smaller \\nalveoli would tend to collapse and cause expansion of \\nthe larger alveoli. This instability of alveoli does not \\noccur normally for the following reasons:\\n •  Interdependence. The adjacent alveoli, alveolar ducts, \\nand other air spaces tend to support each other in \\nsuch a way that a large alveolus usually cannot exist \\nalongside a small alveolus because they share com\\xad\\nmon septal walls.\\n •  Fibrous tissue. The lung is constructed of about \\n50,000 functional units, each of which contains one \\nor a few alveolar ducts and their associated alveoli. \\nAll of them are surrounded by fibrous septa that act \\nas additional supports.\\n •  Surfactant. Surfactant reduces surface tension, al\\xad\\nlowing the interdependence phenomenon and fi\\xad\\nbrous tissue to overcome the surface tension effects. \\nAs an alveolus becomes smaller, the surfactant mol\\xad\\necules on the alveolar surface are squeezed together, \\nincreasing their concentration and thereby reducing \\nthe surface tension still further.\\nPULMONARY VOLUMES AND CAPACITIES (p. 501)\\nMost pulmonary volumes and capacities can be mea \\xad\\nsured with a spirometer.

However, under disease \\nconditions, the smaller bronchioles often play a greater \\nrole in determining air flow resistance for two reasons: \\n(1) they are easily occluded because of their small size, \\nand (2) they are easily constricted because they have \\na greater proportion of smooth muscle fibers in their \\nwalls in relation to their diameter.\\nEpinephrine and Norepinephrine Cause Dilation of the \\nBronchiole Tree.

The pulmonary artery has \\na thin wall and is distensible, giving the pulmonary \\narterial tree a large amount of compliance. This large \\namount of compliance allows the pulmonary arteries \\nto accommodate about two thirds of the stroke vol-\\nume of the right ventricle with only limited increases \\nin pressure. The pulmonary veins have distensibility \\ncharacteristics similar to those of veins in the sys-\\ntemic circulation.\\n •  Bronchial circulation. Bronchial blood flow amounts \\nto about 1 to 2 percent of the total cardiac output. \\nOxygenated blood in the bronchial arteries supplies \\nthe connective tissue, septa, and large and small \\nbronchi of the lungs. Because the bronchial blood \\nempties into the pulmonary veins and bypasses the \\nright heart, the left ventricular output is about 1 to 2 \\npercent greater than the right ventricular output.\\n •  Lymphatic circulation. Lymphatics are found in all \\nthe supportive tissues of the lungs. Particulate ma-\\nterials entering the alveoli are removed by way of \\nlymphatic channels; plasma proteins leaking from \\nthe lung capillaries are also removed from the lung \\ntissues, helping prevent edema.\\nPRESSURES IN THE PULMONARY SYSTEM (p. 509)\\nBlood Pressures in the Pulmonary Circulation Are Low \\nCompared With Those in the Systemic Circulation. \\n •  Pulmonary artery pressure.

Through indirect \\nmeans, the mean pulmonary capillary pressure has \\nbeen estimated to be about 7 mm Hg.\\n •  Left atrial and pulmonary venous pressures. The \\nmean pressure in the left atrium and the major pulmo-\\nnary veins averages about 2 mm Hg in the recumbent \\nhuman being.\\nLeft Atrial Pressure Can Be Estimated by Measuring the \\nPulmonary Wedge Pressure. Direct measurement of left \\natrial pressure is difficult because it requires passing \\na catheter retrograde through the left ventricle. The \\npulmonary wedge pressure can be measured by floating \\na balloon-tipped catheter through the right heart and \\npulmonary artery until the catheter wedges tightly in \\na smaller branch of the artery. Because all blood flow \\nhas been stopped in the blood vessels extending from \\nthe plugged artery, an almost direct connection is made \\nthrough the pulmonary capillaries with the blood in the \\npulmonary veins. The wedge pressure is usually only 2 \\nto 3 mm Hg higher than the left atrial pressure. Wedge \\npressure measurements often are used to study changes \\nin left atrial pressure in persons with various types of \\nleft heart failure.\\nBLOOD VOLUME OF THE LUNGS (p. 510)\\nThe Lung Vasculature Provides a Blood Reservoir Function. \\nThe pulmonary blood volume is about 450 milliliters, or \\nabout 9 percent of the total blood volume.

When the alveolar oxygen concentration \\ndecreases below normal, the adjacent blood vessels \\nconstrict, which is opposite to the effect normally \\nobserved in systemic blood vessels. This vasoconstrictor \\neffect of a low oxygen level serves to distribute blood flow \\naway from poorly ventilated areas of the lung.\\nThe Autonomic Nervous System Does Not Have a \\nMajor Influence on Pulmonary Vascular Resistance. How -\\never, sympathetic stimulation has a significant effect in \\nconstricting the large pulmonary capacitative vessels, \\nespecially the veins.

Under normal and various \\npathological conditions, any one of three possible zones \\nof pulmonary blood flow can be found:\\n •  Zone 1 (top of the lung) has no blood flow because the \\ncapillary pressure never rises higher than the alveolar \\npressure. In this zone, alveolar pressure > artery pres-\\nsure > venous pressure, and thus the capillaries are \\npressed flat. Zone 1 does not occur during normal con-\\nditions; it can occur when pulmonary artery pressure \\nis decreased after hemorrhage and when alveolar pres-\\nsure is increased during positive-pressure ventilation.\\n •  Zone 2 (middle of the lung) has an intermittent blood \\nflow that occurs during systole, when the arterial \\npressure is greater than the alveolar pressure; how-\\never, blood flow does not occur during diastole, when \\nthe arterial pressure is less than the alveolar pressure. \\nZone 2 blood flow is thus determined by the differ -\\nence between arterial and alveolar pressures.'),\n",

Peripheral chemoreceptors also respond to changes \\nin Pco 2 and hydrogen ion concentration. The following \\ntwo types of chemoreceptors transmit nervous signals \\nto the respiratory center to help regulate respiratory \\nactivity:\\n •  The carotid bodies are located in the bifurcations of \\nthe common carotid arteries; their afferent nerve fi-\\nbers innervate the dorsal respiratory area of the me-\\ndulla.\\n •  The aortic bodies are located along the arch of the \\naorta; their afferent nerve fibers also innervate the \\ndorsal respiratory area.\\nThe Oxygen Lack Stimulus Is Often Counteracted by \\nDecreases in Blood P co2  and Hydrogen Ion Concentration . \\nWhen a person breathes air that has too little oxygen, \\nthe decrease in arterial Po 2 excites the carotid and \\naortic chemoreceptors, thereby increasing respiration. \\nThe increase in respiration leads to a decrease in both \\narterial Pco2 and hydrogen ion concentration. These \\ntwo changes severely depress the respiratory center, \\nso the final effect of increased respiration in response \\nto low Po2 is mostly counteracted. The effect of low \\narterial Po 2 on alveolar ventilation is far greater under \\nsome other conditions, including the following:\\n •  Pulmonary disease. With pneumonia, emphysema, \\nor other conditions that prevent adequate gas ex-\\nchange through the pulmonary membrane, too little \\noxygen is absorbed into the arterial blood, and at \\nthe same time, the arterial Pco2 and hydrogen ion \\nconcentration remain near normal or are increased \\nbecause of poor transport of carbon dioxide through \\nthe membrane.\\n •  Acclimatization to low oxygen. When climbers as -\\ncend a mountain over a period of days rather than a \\nperiod of hours, they can withstand far lower atmo-\\nspheric oxygen concentrations because the respira -\\ntory center loses about four fifths of its sensitivity to \\nchanges in arterial Pco 2 and hydrogen ions, and the \\nlow oxygen can then drive the respiratory system to \\na much higher level of alveolar ventilation.'),\n",

These effects depend on the \\nseverity of the disease and the relative degree of \\nbronchiolar obstruction versus lung parenchymal \\ndestruction. Chronic emphysema usually progresses \\nslowly over many years. Emphysema has the following \\nconsequences:\\n •  Increased airway resistance. This is caused by bron-\\nchiolar obstruction.

This is caused by the \\nmarked loss of alveolar walls, which reduces the abil-\\nity of the lungs to oxygenate the blood and remove \\ncarbon dioxide.\\n •  Abnormal ventilation-perfusion ratio ( ˙VA/˙Q). Areas \\nof the lung with bronchiolar obstruction have a very \\nlow ˙VA/˙Q (physiological shunt), resulting in poor \\naeration of blood, whereas other areas with loss of \\nalveolar walls have a very high ˙VA/˙Q (physiological \\ndead space), resulting in wasted ventilation.\\n •  Increased pulmonary vascular resistance.

Acclimatization makes it possible for a person to \\nwork harder without hypoxic effects or to ascend to \\nstill higher altitudes. The principal mechanisms of \\nacclimatization are as follows:\\n •  Increased pulmonary ventilation\\n •  Inc reased concentration of red blood cells in blood\\n •  Inc reased diffusing capacity of lungs\\n •  Inc reased vascularity of tissues\\n •  Inc reased ability of cells to use oxygen despite the \\nlow Po2\\nPulmonary Ventilation Can Increase Fivefold in an \\nAcclimatized Person but Only About 65 Percent in an \\nUnacclimatized Person. Acute exposure to a hypoxic \\nenvironment increases alveolar ventilation to a \\nmaximum of about 65 percent above normal. If a person \\nremains at a very high altitude for several days, the \\nventilation gradually increases to an average of about \\nfive times normal (400 percent above normal).\\n •  Acute increase in pulmonary ventilation. The immedi-\\nate 65 percent increase in pulmonary ventilation upon \\nrising to a high altitude blows off large quantities of \\ncarbon dioxide, reducing the Pco2  and increasing the \\npH of body fluids. Both of these changes inhibit the \\nrespiratory center and thereby oppose the effect of \\nlow Po2  to stimulate the peripheral respiratory che -\\nmoreceptors in the carotid and aortic bodies.\\n •  Chronic increase in pulmonary ventilation. The acute \\ninhibition fades away within 2 to 5 days, allowing the \\nrespiratory center to respond with full force, increas-\\ning the ventilation by about fivefold. The decreased \\ninhibition results mainly from a reduction in bicar-\\nbonate ion concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid \\nand brain tissues. This in turn decreases the pH in \\nthe fluids surrounding the chemosensitive neurons \\nof the medullary respiratory center, thereby increas-\\ning the activity of the center.\\nHematocrit and Blood Volume Increase During \\nAcclimatization.

This increase in \\nhemoglobin concentration and blood volume begins \\nafter 2 weeks, reaching half development within a \\nmonth and full development only after many months.\\nThe Pulmonary Diffusing Capacity Can Increase as Much \\nas Threefold After Acclimatization. The normal diffusing \\ncapacity for oxygen through the pulmonary membrane \\nis about 21 ml/mm Hg/min. The following factors con -\\ntribute to the threefold increase after acclimatization:\\n •  Increased pulmonary capillary blood volume  ex -\\npands the capillaries and increases the surface area \\nthrough which oxygen can diffuse into the blood.\\n •  Increased lung volume  expands the surface area of \\nthe alveolar membrane.\\n •  Increased pulmonary arterial pressure  forces blood \\ninto greater numbers of alveolar capillaries, especial -\\nly in the upper parts of the lungs, which are poorly \\nperfused under usual conditions.\\nChronic Hypoxia Increases the Number of Capillaries in \\nSome Tissues. Cardiac output often increases as much \\nas 30 percent immediately after a person ascends to \\nhigh altitude but then decreases toward normal as \\nthe blood hematocrit increases; thus, the amount of \\noxygen transported to tissues remains about normal. \\nThe number of capillaries in some tissues increases, \\nespecially in animals born and bred at high altitudes. \\nThe greater capillarity is especially marked in tissues in \\nwhich the vasculature has mainly a nutritive function \\n(which does not include kidney tissue).\\nChronic Mountain Sickness  Can Develop in a Person \\nWho Remains at a High Altitude Too Long. The following \\neffects contribute to the development of mountain \\nsickness: (1) the red blood cell mass and hematocrit \\nbecome extremely high; (2) the pulmonary arterial \\npressure increases even more than normal; (3) the \\nright side of the heart becomes greatly enlarged; (4) the \\nperipheral arterial pressure begins to fall; (5) congestive \\nheart failure ensues; and (6) death often follows unless \\nthe person is moved to a lower altitude.\\nWEIGHTLESSNESS IN SPACE (p. 567)\\nPhysiological Problems Exist With Weightlessness .

However, enormous variability exists in \\nthe morphology of individual neurons in different parts \\nof the brain. It is estimated that the nervous system is \\ncomposed of more than 100 billion neurons.\\nMuch of the activity in the nervous system arises \\nfrom stimulation of sensory receptors located at distal \\nterminations of sensory neurons. Signals travel over \\nperipheral nerves to reach the spinal cord and are then \\ntransmitted throughout the brain. Incoming sensory \\nmessages are processed and integrated with informa-\\ntion stored in neuronal pools so the resulting signals \\ncan be used to generate an appropriate motor response.\\nThe motor division of the nervous system controls \\na variety of bodily activities such as contraction of stri -\\nated and smooth muscles and secretion by exocrine and \\nendocrine glands. Only a relatively small proportion of \\nthe sensory input received by the brain is actually used \\nto generate an immediate motor response.

The transmission of signals at \\nchemical synapses is “one way”—from the presynaptic \\naxon terminal to the postsynaptic dendrite or soma.\\nThe least common type of synapse (in mammals) \\nis the electrical synapse.

For example, the entire brain can be consid-\\nered a neuronal pool. Other neuronal pools include the \\ncerebral cortex, thalamus, an individual nucleus in the \\nthalamus, and so forth. Despite the large differences in \\nfunction, neuronal pools have many similar principles \\nof function.\\nAfferent Input Systems Can Provide Either Threshold \\nor Subthreshold Stimulation  to a Neuronal Pool. Action \\npotentials can be generated by a group of neurons \\nwhen they are stimulated to their respective threshold \\npotentials. In other groups of neurons, the membrane \\npotentials may be slightly depolarized, but not enough \\nto reach a threshold value. These neurons are said to \\nbe facilitated because they can now be excited by small \\nexcitatory postsynaptic potentials that would otherwise \\nprovide a subthreshold level of stimulation.\\nIn Some Neuronal Pools, Divergence of Incoming \\nSignals Is a Common Feature . This divergence may take \\none of two forms. With an amplification mechanism, \\na single input nerve fiber branches to contact two or \\nmore postsynaptic neurons that in turn have branches \\nthat also stimulate two or more additional neurons; the \\ninitial signal from the input neuron is thus amplified \\nmany times by successive neurons in the pool. With \\nanother form of divergence, the activated neurons \\nin the pool project to multiple targets at different \\nlocations.\\nThe Processing in Neuronal Pools Might Utilize the \\nMechanism of Convergence. Multiple input fibers from \\na single afferent neuron may terminate on a single \\nneuron in the pool, greatly increasing the probability \\nof achieving an action potential in the postsynaptic \\nneuron. Another type of convergence occurs when \\ninput signals from multiple different afferent sources '),\n",

A single input fiber may \\nprovide excitatory output to one neuron in the next \\n(postsynaptic) pool that is itself an excitatory (relay) \\nneuron, or it may synapse with an inhibitory interneuron \\nin the next pool, which might then inhibit relay neurons \\nin the postsynaptic pool.\\nSignal Processing in Neuronal Pools Can Involve a \\nReverberating Circuit  or Oscillating Circuits . In these \\ncircuits, the output axons of the pool give rise to \\ncollateral branches that synapse with excitatory  \\ninterneurons located within  the pool. These \\nexcitatory interneurons then provide feedback \\nto the same output neurons of the pool, leading \\nto a self-propagating sequence of signals. The \\nexcitatory postsynaptic potentials produced by the \\nexcitatory interneurons can be facilitatory or may \\nactually stimulate firing by the output neurons. \\nThe latter situation is the substrate for a neuronal \\ncell group that emits a continuous train of efferent \\nsignals. Some neuronal pools generate a rhythmical \\noutput signal, such as the respiratory centers in the \\nmedullary reticular formation.

The output of a neuronal pool \\nactivates inhibitory interneurons located in the pool \\nthat then provide inhibitory feedback to the main \\noutput neurons of the pool. Such a circuit forms \\nan internally regulated “brake” on the output of the \\npool.\\n •  Synaptic fatigue means that synaptic transmission \\nbecomes progressively weaker the more long and \\nintense the period of excitation. The mechanism for \\nsynaptic fatigue may involve transmitter depletion, \\nfailure of transmitter release because of decreased \\nuptake or utilization of calcium, or downregulation \\nof receptors when there is overactivity.'),\n",

Pacinian corpuscles detect the \\nmost rapid vibratory stimuli (30 to 800 cycles/sec) and \\nare linked to the large, rapidly conducting myelinated \\nfibers (type Aβ).

These modalities include \\ndiscriminative touch, vibration, and proprioception. \\nIn a similar manner, somatosensory information from \\nthe face is carried mainly in branches of the trigeminal \\nnerve. When trigeminal nerve fibers enter the brain \\nstem, they also segregate into two pathways: one is \\nspecialized for processing pain, temperature, and crude \\ntouch, and the other is responsible for discriminative \\ntouch, vibration, and proprioception.\\nTRANSMISSION IN THE DORSAL COLUMN–\\nMEDIAL LEMNISCAL SYSTEM (p. 609)\\nThe Anatomy of the DC-ML System Is \\nCharacterized by a High Degree of Somatotopic \\n(Spatial) Organization\\n •  Primary sensory neurons. The central processes of \\nprimary sensory neurons that enter the spinal cord \\nthrough the medial aspect of the dorsal root are the \\nlarger, myelinated fibers carrying signals related to \\ndiscriminative touch, vibration, and proprioception. \\nOn entering the cord, some of these fibers form local \\nsynapses in the gray matter, and many simply pass \\ninto the dorsal column area and ascend without syn-\\napsing until they reach the dorsal column nuclei in \\nthe caudal medulla. Here, fibers carrying informa-\\ntion from the lower extremities synapse in the nucle-\\nus gracilis, whereas those from the upper extremity \\nterminate in the nucleus cuneatus.\\n •  Dorsal column nuclei.  Axons of cells in the cune -\\nate and gracile nuclei form the medial lemniscus, \\nwhich crosses the midline in the caudal medulla as \\nthe sensory decussation. This fiber bundle continues \\nrostrally to the thalamus, where the axons terminate \\nin the ventrobasal complex, mainly the ventral pos -\\nterior lateral nucleus (VPL).

Throughout the system, a point-to-point \\nrelationship exists between the origin in the periph-\\nery and the termination in the SI.\\n •  Somatosensory signals from the face. Tactile somato-\\nsensory signals from the face travel in the trigeminal \\nnerve and enter the brain stem at midpontine levels, \\nwhere the primary sensory fibers terminate in the \\nprincipal trigeminal sensory nucleus. From here, ax-\\nons cross the midline and course rostrally, adjacent \\nto the medial lemniscus, and eventually terminate \\nmedially in a portion of the ventrobasal complex, the \\nventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM). This system \\nof fibers is comparable to the DC-ML system and \\nconveys similar types of somatosensory information \\nfrom the face (e.g., vibration, fine touch, pressure, \\nand proprioceptive signals).\\n •  Somatosensory areas of the cerebral cortex. The post -\\ncentral gyrus comprises the primary somatosensory \\ncortex, which corresponds to Brodmann’s areas 3, \\n1, and 2. A second somatosensory area (SII) that \\nis much smaller than SI is located just posterior to \\nthe face region of SI bordering on the lateral fissure. \\nWithin SI, segregation of body parts is maintained \\nsuch that the face region is ventrally located nearest \\nthe lateral fissure, the upper extremity continues me-\\ndially and dorsally from the face region and extends \\ntoward the convexity of the hemisphere, and the \\nlower extremity projects onto the medial surface of \\nthe hemisphere. In fact, there is a complete but sepa-\\nrate body representation in areas 3, 1, and 2. Within \\neach of these body representations, an unequal vol-\\nume of cortex is devoted to each body part.

Two-point discrimination is often used to \\ndetermine an individual’s ability to distinguish two \\nsimultaneously applied cutaneous stimuli as two separate \\n“points. ” This capability varies substantially over the body \\nsurface because of differences in sensory receptor density. \\nOn the fingertips and lips, two points of stimulation \\nas close together as 1 to 2 mm can be distinguished as \\nseparate points, whereas on the back, the two points \\nmust be separated by at least 30 to 70 mm. This function \\ndepends on the central processing elements in the DC-\\nML pathway to recognize that the two excitatory signals \\ngenerated peripherally are separate and not overlapping.\\nLateral Inhibition Is a Mechanism Used Throughout the \\nNervous System to “Sharpen” Signal Transmission. Lateral \\ninhibition uses inhibition of the input from the peripheral \\nportion of a receptive field to define better the boundaries \\nof the excited zone.

In contrast, \\nthe slow, chronic type of pain signals are transmitted via \\ntype C fibers at velocities ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 m/\\nsec. These two types of nerve fibers are segregated in \\nthe spinal cord; type Aδ fibers excite neurons primar -\\nily in lamina I of the dorsal horn, whereas type C fibers \\nexcite neurons in the substantia gelatinosa. The latter \\ncells then project deeper into the gray matter and acti-\\nvate neurons located mainly in lamina V but also in \\nlaminae VI and VII.

For \\nexample, pain from the left heart wall is referred to the \\nsurface of the left side of the jaw and neck or the left \\narm, where the patient believes the pain originates. \\nSuch referred pain implies that visceral afferent signals \\nfrom the heart converge on the same spinal cord neu-\\nrons that receive cutaneous input from the periphery \\n(or the convergence may occur in the thalamus).\\nClinical Abnormalities of Pain and Other Somatic \\nSensations (p. 628)\\n •  Hyperalgesia involves a heightened sensitivity to \\npainful stimuli. Local tissue damage or the local re-\\nlease of certain chemicals can lower the threshold \\nfor activation of pain receptors and the subsequent \\ngeneration of pain signals.\\n •  In terruption of the blood supply or damage to the \\nventrobasal thalamus (somatosensory region) may \\ncause the thalamic pain syndrome. This is initially \\ncharacterized by a loss of all sensation over the con-\\ntralateral body surface. Sensations may return after \\na few weeks to months, but they are poorly local-\\nized and almost always painful. Eventually, a state is \\nreached in which even minor skin stimulation can \\nlead to excruciatingly painful sensations, which is \\nknown as hyperpathia.\\n •  V iral infection of a dorsal root ganglion or cranial \\nnerve sensory ganglion may lead to segmental pain \\nand a severe skin rash in the area served by the affected \\nganglion. This is known as herpes zoster (shingles).'),\n",

The source of headache \\npain stimuli may be intracranial or extracranial; in this \\nchapter we focus on intracranial sources. The brain \\nitself is insensitive to pain.

Pressure on the venous \\nsinuses and stretching of the dura or blood vessels and \\ncranial nerves that pass through the dura lead to the \\nsensation of headache.

With prolonged spasm and ischemia, the \\nmuscular wall of the affected vessel can lose its ability \\nto maintain normal tone. The pulsation of circulating \\nblood alternately stretches (dilates) and relaxes the ves-\\nsel wall, which stimulates pain receptors in the vascular \\nwall or in the meninges surrounding the entry points \\nof vessels into the brain or cranium. The result is an \\nintense headache.\\nHeadache of Extracranial Origin (p. 630)\\nEmotional tension can cause the muscles of the head, \\nespecially those attached to the scalp and neck, to \\nbecome spastic and irritate the attachment areas. Irrita-\\ntion of the nasal and accessory nasal structures can lead \\nto a “sinus headache. ” Difficulty in focusing the eyes can \\nlead to excessive contraction of the ciliary muscle and \\nthe muscles of the face, such as when a person squints to \\nsharpen the focus of an object. This contraction can lead \\nto eye and facial pain, commonly known as an eyestrain \\ntype of headache.\\nTHERMAL SENSATIONS\\nThermal Receptors and Their Excitation (p. 630)\\n •  Pain receptors are stimulated only by extreme de-\\ngrees of coldness or warmth.

Both \\ncold and warmth receptors can be stimulated with tem -\\nperatures in the range of 31°C to 43°C.\\nWhen the cold receptor is subjected to an abrupt \\ntemperature decrease, it is strongly stimulated ini -\\ntially. Then, after the first few seconds, the generation \\nof action potentials falls off dramatically. However, the \\ndecrease in firing progresses more slowly during the \\nnext 30 minutes or so, which means that the cold and \\nwarm receptors respond to steady state temperature as \\nwell as to changes in temperature. This explains why a \\ncold outdoor temperature “feels” so much colder at first \\nas one emerges from a warm environment.\\nThe stimulatory mechanism in thermal receptors is \\nbelieved to result from temperature-induced changes in \\nmetabolic rate in the nerve fiber. For every 10°C temper-\\nature change, there is an approximate twofold change in \\nthe rate of intracellular chemical reactions.\\nThe density of thermal receptors on the skin surface \\nis relatively small. Therefore, temperature changes that \\naffect only a small surface area are not as effectively \\ndetected as temperature changes that affect a large area \\nof skin.

When a \\nlight wave passes through an angulated surface, it \\nis bent (refracted) at some angle if the refractive \\nindices of the two media are different.

The Special Senses\\n362\\nOPTICS OF THE EYE (p. 638)\\nThe eye is optically equivalent to a photographic camera. It \\nhas a lens, a variable aperture (the pupil), and a retina, which \\ncorresponds to the film. The lens system of the eye focuses \\nan inverted, upside down image on the retina. However, we \\nperceive the image as right side up because the brain has \\n“learned” that this orientation is correct or normal.\\nThe Mechanism of Accommodation Is a Change in Lens \\nShape That Allows the Eye to Focus on a Near Object . When \\nshifting the gaze from a far object to a near object, the \\nprocess of accommodation involves (1) making the lens \\nmore convex, (2) narrowing the pupillary diameter, \\nand (3) adducting (vergence) both eyes. When the \\nlens is in a “relaxed” state with no tension exerted on \\nthe edges of its capsule, it assumes a nearly spherical \\nshape owing to its own intrinsic elastic properties. \\nWhen the inelastic zonule fibers attached to the lens \\nperimeter become taut and are pulled radially by their \\nattachment to the inactive ciliary muscle, the lens is \\nrelatively flat or less convex. When the ciliary muscle \\nis activated by postganglionic parasympathetic fibers in \\nthe oculomotor nerve, the circular fibers of the ciliary \\nmuscle contract, producing a sphincter-like action that \\nrelaxes the tension on the zonule fibers and allows the \\nlens to become more convex owing to its own inherent \\nelasticity. This increases its refractive capability and \\nallows the eye to focus on near objects. At the same \\ntime, the sphincter pupillae muscle is activated, the \\npupil constricts, and the two eyes are medially deviated.\\nPresbyopia Is the Loss of Accommodation by the \\nLens. As an individual ages, the lens begins to lose its \\nintrinsic elastic properties and becomes less responsive \\nand less able to focus on near objects. This condition \\n(presbyopia) is corrected with reading glasses designed \\nto magnify near objects or with bifocals in which one \\nlens (the upper portion) is designed to enhance distance \\nvision and the second lens (the lower portion) has \\ngreater refractive capability to improve near vision.\\nThe Diameter of the Pupil (Iris) Is Also a Factor in \\nAccommodation. More light enters the eye when \\nthe diameter of the pupil increases. Squinting (i.e., \\nnarrowing the pupil opening) improves the sharpness \\nof the image by increasing the focal plane.\\nErrors of Refraction (p. 640)\\n •  Emmetropia refers to the normal eye.

However, if the head is moved from \\nside to side, close objects move rapidly across the retina, \\nwhereas distant objects move very little or not at all.\\nBinocular vision also aids in determining the dis -\\ntance of an object. Because the eyes are typically about \\n2 inches apart, an object placed 1 inch in front of the \\nbridge of the nose is seen by a small part of the periph-\\neral retina of both eyes.

In addition, vitamin \\nA is converted to retinal, providing even more photo-\\nsensitive pigment (a process called dark adaptation). \\nThis latter process occurs about four times as rapidly \\nin cones as in rods, but cones exhibit less sensitivity \\nchange in the dark. Cones cease adapting after only a \\nfew minutes, whereas the more slowly adapting rods \\ncontinue to adapt for minutes to hours, and their sensi -\\ntivity increases over a broad range.\\nAdaptation can also occur through changes in pupil-\\nlary size; the size of pupils can change 30-fold within \\na fraction of a second. Neural adaptation can also take \\nplace in the circuits that exist within the retina and brain. \\nIf light intensity increases, transmission from bipolar \\ncells to horizontal cells to amacrine and ganglion cells \\nmay also increase. Although the latter form of adapta-\\ntion is less substantial than pupillary changes, neural \\nadaptation, such as pupillary adaptation, occurs rapidly.\\nThe value of light and dark adaptive processes is that \\nthey provide the eye with the ability to change its sensitiv -\\nity by as much as 500,000-fold to 1 million-fold. This abil -\\nity can be appreciated when entering a dark room from \\na brightly lit environment. The sensitivity of the retina is \\nlow because it is adapted to light, and little can be seen \\nin the dark room. As dark adaptation progresses, night \\nvision improves. The intensity of sunlight is estimated to \\nbe 10 billion times greater than light intensity on a starlit \\nnight, yet the eye can function to some degree under both \\nconditions because of its enormous adaptive range.\\nCOLOR VISION (p. 654)\\nTricolor Mechanism of Color Detection\\nSpectral sensitivity of the three types of cone is based \\non the light absorption curves for the three cone pig-\\nments. All visible color (other than blue, green, or red) is \\nthe result of combined stimulation of two or more types \\nof cone. The nervous system then interprets the ratio of \\nactivity of the three types as a color. Equal stimulation of \\nblue, green, and red cones is interpreted as white light.'),\n",

These muscles are innervated by \\nmotoneurons in the nuclei of the third, fourth, and sixth \\ncranial nerves. The activity of these motoneurons is \\ninfluenced by a variety of areas in the brain, including \\ncells in the frontal, parietal, and occipital lobes, as well \\nas the brain stem reticular formation, the superior col-\\nliculus, the cerebellum, and the vestibular nuclei.

When the eyes rapidly jump \\nfrom one object to another, each jump is called a saccade. \\nThese movements are rapid, and the brain suppresses \\nthe visual image during the movement so one typically \\nis not conscious of the point-to-point movement.\\nPursuit Movements Occur When the Eyes Fixate on a \\nMoving Target. The control system for pursuit movements \\ninvolves the transmission of visual information to the \\ncerebellum by various routes. The brain then computes \\nthe trajectory of the target and activates the appropriate \\nmotoneurons to move the eyes so the target is kept in \\nfocus on the fovea.\\nThe superior colliculi are mainly responsible for ori-\\nenting the eyes and head toward a visual (or auditory) \\nstimulus.

Interest -\\ningly, other sensory inputs, such as audition and somato -\\nsensation, are funneled through the superior colliculus \\nand its descending connections such that the superior \\ncolliculus performs a global integrating function with \\nrespect to orientation of the eyes and body toward vari-\\nous stimulus points.\\nAUTONOMIC CONTROL OF ACCOMMODATION \\nAND PUPILLARY APERTURE (p. 669)\\nParasympathetic fibers to the eye originate in the \\nEdinger-Westphal nucleus and course via the oculomo -\\ntor nerve to the ciliary ganglion, where postganglionic \\nfibers originate and extend to the eye via ciliary nerves. \\nSympathetic fibers originate in the intermediolateral cell \\ncolumn of the spinal cord and pass to the superior cer -\\nvical ganglion. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers course \\non the internal carotid and ophthalmic arteries, eventu-\\nally reaching the eye.\\nWhen the fixation point of the eyes changes, the \\nfocusing power of the lens is adjusted in the proper \\ndirection by appropriate activation of the autonomic \\ninnervation of the ciliary and sphincter pupillae muscles \\nin each eye.\\nWhen the eyes focus from far to near (or vice versa), \\nthey must also converge. Convergence involves bilat -\\neral activation of the medial rectus muscles in each eye. \\nThe areas of the brain that control pupillary changes \\nand convergence are sufficiently separated because \\nlesions may disrupt one function but not the other.

This watery fluid is different from \\nthe perilymph in the scala vestibuli and scala tympani, \\nwhich, like extracellular fluid, is high in sodium and low \\nin potassium. The endolymph is secreted by the stria \\nvascularis (specialized epithelium in the wall of the scala \\nmedia), and it is high in potassium and low in sodium. \\nThe electrical potential across the endolymph, called \\nthe endocochlear potential, is about +80 millivolts. \\nHowever, the interior of the hair cell is about −70 \\nmillivolts. Therefore, the potential difference across the \\nmembrane of the cilia and apical surface of the hair cells \\nis about 150 millivolts, which greatly increases their \\nsensitivity.\\nDetermination of Sound Frequency—The \\n“Place” Principle (p. 677)\\nThe nervous system determines sound frequency by \\nthe point of maximal stimulation along the basilar \\nmembrane. Sounds at the high-frequency end of the \\nspectrum maximally stimulate the basal end near the \\noval window. Low-frequency stimulation maximally \\nstimulates the apical end near the helicotrema. Sound \\nfrequencies below 200 Hz, however, are discriminated \\ndifferently. These frequencies cause synchronized vol-\\nleys of impulses at the same frequency in the eighth cra-\\nnial nerve, and cells in the cochlear nuclei that receive \\ninput from these fibers can distinguish the frequencies.\\nDetermination of Loudness (p. 678)\\n 1.   A s the sound becomes louder, the amplitude of vi -\\nbration in the basilar membrane increases, and hair \\ncells are activated more rapidly.\\n 2.   W ith increased amplitude of vibration, more hair \\ncells are activated, and spatial summation enhances \\nthe signal.\\n 3.   O uter hair cells are activated by large-amplitude vi -\\nbrations, which somehow signal the nervous system \\nthat the sound has surpassed a certain level that de-\\nlimits high intensity.\\nThe auditory system can discriminate between a soft \\nwhisper and a loud noise that might represent as much \\nas a 1 trillion times increase in sound energy. Thus, the \\nintensity scale is compressed by the brain to provide a \\nwide range of sound discrimination.'),\n",

For example, a 3000-Hz tone can be \\nheard at an intensity level of 70 decibels, whereas a 100-\\nHz tone can be heard only if the intensity is increased to \\na level 10,000 times as great.\\nThe range of hearing is typically listed as 20 to 20,000 \\nHz.

From here, signals are sent to the con-\\ntralateral (and ipsilateral) superior olivary nucleus,  \\nwhere cells give rise to nerve fibers that enter the lat -\\neral lemniscus, which terminates in the inferior col-\\nliculus.  Cells in the inferior colliculus project to the \\nmedial geniculate nucleus  of the thalamus, and from \\nhere signals are transmitted to the primary auditory \\ncortex, the transverse temporal gyrus of Heschl. It is \\nimportant to understand that (1) beginning with the \\noutput from the cochlear nuclei, signals are transmit-\\nted bilaterally through central pathways with a con -\\ntralateral predominance; (2) collaterals from central \\npathways synapse in the brain stem reticular forma -\\ntion; and (3) spatial representations of sound fre -\\nquency (tonotopic organization) are found at many \\nlevels in the various cell groups of the central audi -\\ntory pathways.\\nFunction of the Cerebral Cortex in Hearing  \\n(p. 680)\\nThe primary auditory cortex corresponds to Brodma -\\nnn’s areas 41 and 42. Surrounding these areas is area 22, \\na portion of which is considered the secondary auditory \\ncortex.\\nAt least six tonotopic representations (maps) of \\nsound frequency have been described in the primary \\nauditory cortex.

The lateral subnucleus determines \\nsound direction by detecting the difference in sound \\nintensity transmitted from the two ears. The medial \\nsubnucleus localizes sound by detecting the difference \\nin the time of arrival of sound in the two ears. The input \\nto individual cells in the latter nucleus is segregated \\nsuch that signals from the right ear reach one dendritic \\nsystem and input from the left ear synapses with a sepa-\\nrate dendritic system on the same neuron.\\nCentrifugal Signals From the Central Nervous \\nSystem to Lower Auditory Centers (p. 682)\\nEach processing level in the central auditory pathway \\ngives rise to descending or retrograde fibers that proj -\\nect back toward the cochlear nuclei, as well as to the \\ncochlea itself. These centrifugal connections are more \\npronounced in the auditory system than in any other \\nsensory pathway. It is speculated that these connec -\\ntions allow one to attend to particular sound features \\nselectively.\\nHearing Abnormalities (p. 682)\\nHearing difficulties can be assessed with an audiometer, \\nwhich allows specific sound frequencies to be individ-\\nually delivered to each ear. When a patient has nerve \\ndeafness, both air and bone conduction of sound are \\naffected, and the damage usually involves one or more \\nof the neural components of the auditory system. When \\nonly air conduction is affected, damage to the ossicular \\nchain is usually the cause, often due to chronic middle \\near infections.'),\n",

The life span of \\na taste cell is about 10 days in lower mammals but is \\nunknown for humans. The apical surfaces of taste cells \\nare arranged around a taste pore.

Fungiform papillae \\nare found on the anterior two thirds of the tongue, \\ncircumvallate papillae form a V-shaped configuration \\non the posterior third of the tongue, and foliate papillae \\nare found along the lateral margins of the tongue. A \\nsmall number of taste buds are also found on the palate, \\ntonsils, and epiglottis and in the proximal esophagus. \\nEach taste bud typically responds to only one of the \\nfive primary taste substances.

A motor neuron and all \\nthe muscle fibers it innervates are referred to collec-\\ntively as a motor unit.\\nSpinal cord ventral horn motor neurons are of two \\nvarieties: alpha and gamma motor neurons.

The \\ngamma motor neurons are much smaller, with axons \\nabout 5 micrometers in diameter; these neurons con -\\nduct action potentials at a slower velocity than do the \\nalpha motor neurons.\\nA third cell type is the interneuron; these cells con-\\ntribute to motor and sensory functions in the spinal \\ncord. There are about 30 times more interneurons than \\nmotor neurons. Interneurons are small and highly excit-\\nable, with spontaneous firing rates as high as 1500 per \\nsecond.

Each spindle is attached at its \\ndistal ends to the associated extrafusal skeletal muscle. \\nThe central region of each intrafusal fiber is devoid of \\nactin-myosin contractile elements and instead forms \\na capsule containing several nuclei. When the nuclei \\nare arranged more or less linearly, the fiber is called a \\nnuclear chain fiber; when nuclei are simply aggregated \\nor clumped in the central region, the fiber is called a \\nnuclear bag fiber. Typically, a muscle spindle contains \\none to three nuclear bag fibers and three to nine nuclear \\nchain fibers. The distally located contractile elements of \\neach intrafusal fiber are innervated by relatively small \\ngamma motor neuron axons.\\nTwo types of sensory fiber are associated with mus -\\ncle spindle intrafusal fibers. One is called the primary \\nending, or the annulospiral ending. The primary end-\\ning is a type Ia myelinated primary sensory fiber with \\nan average diameter of 17 micrometers and a conduc-\\ntion velocity of 70 to 120 m/sec. Typically, a spindle \\nalso has at least one type II, or secondary, ending that \\nhas an average diameter of 8 micrometers; it is lightly \\nmyelinated and conducts at a slower velocity than the \\ntype Ia fibers. The primary ending wraps itself around \\nthe central (nuclear) region of both a nuclear bag and \\na nuclear chain intrafusal fiber, whereas the secondary \\nending forms numerous small terminal branches that \\ncluster around the nuclear region of only the nuclear \\nchain intrafusal fibers.\\nDynamic and Static Responses of the Muscle \\nSpindle (p. 698)\\nWhen the central region of a spindle is slowly stretched, \\nthe number of impulses in both the primary and sec -\\nondary endings increases in proportion to the degree of \\nstretch; this increase is called the static response. Because \\nthe nuclear chain fibers are innervated by both the pri -\\nmary and secondary sensory fibers, the static response is \\nthought to be mediated by these intrafusal fibers.'),\n",

Those that terminate in the cord synapse directly \\n(monosynaptic) with alpha motor neurons in the ven-\\ntral horn. These neurons innervate extrafusal fibers \\nin the same muscle where the primary sensory fibers \\noriginated. This circuitry is the substrate for the stretch \\nreflex.

For example, tapping on the patellar tendon \\nat the knee stretches spindles in the quadriceps and nor-\\nmally elicits a reflex contraction of that muscle group \\n(stretch reflex), which produces a knee jerk. A reflex \\nthat is too strong or too brisk can indicate one type of \\nproblem, whereas a reflex that is weak or absent sug-\\ngests other problems.\\nClonus—alternating contraction of the agonist and \\nantagonistic muscles crossing a joint—is a sign of abnor -\\nmal stretch reflex function. This sign is often prominent at \\nthe ankle, where rapid, maintained dorsiflexion induced \\nby the examiner might elicit sustained jerking move-\\nments (alternate flexion and extension) of the foot at the \\nankle joint. This is a sign that the spinal cord circuits that \\nmediate the stretch reflex are not being properly influ-\\nenced by the descending projections from the brain.\\nGolgi Tendon Reflex (p. 701)\\nThe Golgi tendon organ is an encapsulated receptor \\nthrough which a small bundle of muscle tendon fibers \\npass just prior to their bony insertion.

This negative input prevents \\ninjury to the muscle when it exceeds its upper limit of \\ntension. In addition, via their ascending projections, \\nthe tendon organs provide input to the cerebellum and \\nmotor areas of the cerebral cortex that are used by these \\ncenters for controlling movement.\\nFLEXOR REFLEX AND THE WITHDRAWAL \\nREFLEXES (p. 702)\\nThe withdrawal (flexor) reflex is elicited by pain recep-\\ntors, usually those located in the skin. The muscles acti-\\nvated are the ones required to remove the body part \\naway from the painful stimulus. Typically they are flexor \\nmuscles in the limbs, but the reflex is not limited to \\nthese muscles. The sensory fibers that carry these sig -\\nnals terminate on the pool of spinal cord interneurons, \\nmost of which provide excitatory input to the appropri-\\nate ventral horn motor neurons, whereas others inhibit \\nmotor neurons that innervate antagonistic muscles. The \\nlatter mechanism is called reciprocal inhibition.\\nCROSSED EXTENSOR REFLEX (p. 703)\\nThe crossed extensor reflex  often occurs in conjunction \\nwith the flexor reflex. Removing a limb from a painful \\nstimulus may require support from one or more body \\nparts. For example, withdrawing the foot might require \\nthat the other foot support the entire body. In this situa-\\ntion, interneurons that receive the incoming pain signal \\nfrom one foot can project across the midline to excite \\nthe appropriate contralateral motor neurons to support \\nthe body; often they are extensor motor neurons. If the \\nlower extremity is initially affected by the pain stimulus, \\nit also is possible for impulses to spread to more rostral \\ncord levels through propriospinal neurons that synapse \\nwith motor neurons, thus innervating upper extremity \\nmusculature that might be needed to stabilize the body.\\nREFLEXES OF POSTURE AND LOCOMOTION (p. 704)\\nPostural and Locomotor Reflexes of the Cord\\nIn experiments performed with animals in which the \\nspinal cord has been isolated from the remainder of \\nthe brain by a cervical level transection, certain reflex '),\n",

This circuitry involves connections between flexor \\nand extensor motor neurons in a single cord segment, \\nacross the midline, and rostrally and caudally through \\nthe propriospinal system.\\nSPINAL CORD TRANSECTION AND SPINAL \\nSHOCK (p. 705)\\nWhen the spinal cord is transected, all cord functions \\nbelow the transection become substantially depressed, \\nwhich is referred to as spinal shock. The condition may \\npersist for a few hours, days, or weeks. It is thought to \\nrepresent a period during which the excitability of spi-\\nnal neurons is dramatically reduced owing to the loss of \\nall descending projections. As is the case in other areas \\nof the nervous system, the affected neurons gradually \\nregain their excitability as they reorganize and adapt to \\nthe new levels of reduced synaptic input.\\nSome of the more common symptoms that appear \\nduring spinal shock include the following:\\n •  Arterial blood pressure may fall significantly,  indi-\\ncating that the output of the sympathetic nervous \\nsystem is completely interrupted.\\n •  All skeletal muscle reflexes are nonfunctional. In hu -\\nmans, 2 weeks to several months may be required for \\nreflex activity to return to normal. If the  trans ection \\nis incomplete and some descending pathways re-\\nmain intact, some reflexes become hyperactive.\\n •  Sac ral autonomic reflexes that regulate bladder and \\nbowel function may be suppressed for several weeks.'),\n",

This is \\nsometimes interpreted as an intention or action tremor.\\nExtremely rapid movements such as the finger \\nmovements of a typist are called ballistic  move-\\nments, which implies that the entire movement is \\npreplanned to go into motion, travel a specific dis-\\ntance, and then come to a stop. Saccadic eye move -\\nments are also ballistic movements. These types of \\nmovements are disrupted when the spinocerebel-\\nlum is damaged. The movement is slow to be initi -\\nated, its force development is weak, and it is slow \\nto be terminated, which results in overshoot or past \\npointing.\\nThe Cerebrocerebellum Is Involved With the Planning, \\nSequencing, and Timing of Movement . The lateral \\ncerebellar hemispheres receive the bulk of their input \\nfrom the cerebral cortex via the pontine nuclei and do \\nnot receive projections directly from the spinal cord. The \\nplan of an intended, sequential movement is thought to \\nbe transmitted from the premotor and sensory cortex \\nto the basilar pons and then to the cerebellar nuclei \\nand cortex of the lateral hemisphere. Interestingly, it \\nhas been reported that activity in the dentate nucleus \\nreflects the movement that will be performed, not the \\nongoing movement.\\nWhen the lateral hemisphere is damaged, the tim -\\ning of sequential movements is lost; that is, a suc -\\nceeding movement may begin too early or too late, \\nand complex movements such as writing or running \\nare uncoordinated and do not progress in an orderly \\nsequence from one movement to the next. The tim-\\ning function involved in estimating the progression of \\nauditory and visual phenomena may also be disrupted. \\nFor example, a person can lose the ability to predict \\non the basis of sound or sight how rapidly an object is \\napproaching.'),\n",

However, when this pathway is dysfunctional \\n(as in Huntington’s disease), neurons in the thalamic \\nmotor nuclei are not inhibited from the internal palli -\\ndal segment, which allows thalamocortical neurons to \\nexcite the motor cortex, resulting in the production of \\ninvoluntary movements; these movements are not will-\\nfully initiated by the patient and cannot be stopped.

Both of these features are disrupted \\nin patients who have basal ganglia lesions, particularly \\nthose with lesions that involve the caudate nucleus. This \\ncorrelates well with the fact that the posterior parietal \\ncortex (especially in the nondominant hemisphere) is \\nthe locus for the spatial coordinates of the body and its \\nrelationship with the external environment. This part of \\nthe cortex projects heavily to the caudate nucleus.\\nClinical Syndromes Resulting From Damage to \\nthe Basal Ganglia (p. 734)\\nParkinson’s Disease May Be Caused by the Loss of \\nDopamine-Secreting Nerve Fibers. Parkinson’s disease is \\ncharacterized by (1) the presence of rigidity in many \\nmuscle groups, (2) a tremor present at rest when no \\nvoluntary movement is underway, and (3) difficulty \\ninitiating movement (referred to as akinesia). Much \\nof this symptomatology is thought to be linked to \\nprogressive loss of dopamine-producing cells in the \\nsubstantia nigra. These neurons are known to project \\ndiffusely throughout the caudate and putamen, and the \\nseverity of symptoms seems to be proportional to the \\ndegree of cell loss in the substantia nigra. It is not known \\nwhy these neurons degenerate.\\nSeveral Approaches May Be Used to Treat Parkinson’s \\nDisease. Because the cell loss results in diminished \\nlevels of dopamine, a dopamine precursor, l-dopa, can \\nbe administered to increase dopamine availability. This \\nsubstance can cross the blood-brain barrier, whereas \\ndopamine cannot. This treatment has two major \\nproblems: (1) not all l-dopa consistently reaches the \\nbrain because tissues outside the central nervous system \\nare capable of producing dopamine, and (2) as more and '),\n",

It also appears to slow the degeneration \\nof substantia nigra cells; it can be combined with l-\\ndopa to increase the availability of dopamine.\\n •  Transplantation of fetal substantia nigra neurons into \\nthe caudate and putamen has been tried in an attempt \\nto increase dopamine levels but has had only limited \\nsuccess. The transplanted cells remain viable for only \\na short time (weeks to months), and the use of abort-\\ned fetal tissue creates an ethical dilemma.

It has been reasoned that the \\nmotor deficits seen in Parkinson’s disease result from \\nabnormal signals transmitted from the globus pal-\\nlidus to the thalamus. Although the direct effects of \\ndopamine loss appear to be restricted to the caudate \\nand putamen, their axons projecting to the globus \\npallidus are still functional. Thus, one approach has \\nbeen to position an electrode in the globus pallidus \\nnear its output pathways and to make a destructive \\nlesion that interrupts the projection to the thalamus.\\nHuntington’s Disease Is a Genetically Transmitted, \\nAutosomal-Dominant Disorder. Typically, Huntington’s \\ndisease does not appear until the fourth or fifth decade \\nof life. It is characterized by choreiform (flicking) \\nmovements at certain joints that gradually progress \\nto the point of involving much of the body. Severe \\ndementia also gradually appears in tandem with the \\nmotor deficits. The neural substrate for this disorder \\nis less well understood compared with Parkinson’s \\ndisease. It is thought to involve a loss of γ-aminobutyric \\nacid (GABA) neurons in the caudate and putamen and \\nperhaps also a loss of acetylcholine neurons in several \\nparts of the brain, including the cerebral cortex. The \\ngene responsible for this defect has been isolated and \\ntraced to the short arm of chromosome 4.\\nINTEGRATION OF THE MANY PARTS OF THE \\nTOTAL MOTOR CONTROL SYSTEM (p. 735)\\n •  Spinal cord level.

The output of the motor cortex \\nis delivered to the spinal cord over the vast network \\nof fibers of the corticospinal system. In general, the \\nmotor areas of the cortex can devise a unique and \\nspecific motor program that is sent to the spinal \\ncord, activating various muscle groups. Alternative-\\nly, the cortex may select from among the set of mo -\\ntor patterns defined by intrinsic spinal cord circuitry.\\n •  Cerebellum. The cerebellum functions at several lev -\\nels in the motor control hierarchy. At the spinal cord \\nlevel, it can facilitate stretch reflexes so the ability to \\nmanage an unexpected change in load is enhanced. \\nIn the brain stem, the cerebellum is interconnected \\nwith the vestibular system to aid in the regulation \\nof posture, equilibrium, and eye movements.

These changes cause new pathways, \\nfacilitated pathways, or inhibited pathways to develop \\nin the appropriate neural circuitry. The new or altered \\npathways are called memory traces. Although we think \\nof memories as positive collections of previous experi -\\nences, many probably are, in a sense, negative memories. \\nOur minds are inundated with sensory information, and \\nan important brain function is the ability to ignore irrel-\\nevant or extraneous information. This process is called \\nhabituation. Conversely, the brain also has the capac-\\nity to enhance or store certain memory traces through \\nfacilitation of synaptic circuits, a mechanism referred to \\nas memory sensitization.\\nIt is obvious that some memories last only a few sec-\\nonds, whereas others last hours, days, months, or years. \\nConsequently, three categories of memories have been \\ndescribed: (1) short-term memories that last only sec-\\nonds or minutes unless they are converted to long-term \\nmemory; (2) intermediate long-term memory that lasts '),\n",

Short-term memory is typified \\nby the memory of a new telephone number recalled \\nfor a few seconds or minutes as one continues to think \\nabout the number. Several theories concerning the \\nsubstrate for this mechanism are under investigation: \\n(1) this type of memory is due to continuous neural \\nactivity in a reverberating circuit, (2) it occurs as a result \\nof activation of synapses on presynaptic terminals that \\ntypically result in prolonged facilitation or inhibition, \\nand (3) the accumulation of calcium in axon terminals \\nmay eventually lead to enhanced synaptic output from \\nthat terminal.\\nIntermediate Long-Term Memory. Intermediate long-\\nterm memory can result from temporary chemical or \\nphysical changes in either the presynaptic or postsynaptic \\nmembrane that can persist for a few minutes up to \\nseveral weeks. Some experimental observations on such \\nmechanisms have come from studies in the snail Aplysia, \\nas shown in Figure 58–1. Stimulation of a facilitator \\nterminal at the same time as activation of another \\nsensory input causes serotonin to be released at synaptic \\nsites on the sensory terminal. Stimulation of serotonin \\nreceptors activates adenyl cyclase in the main sensory \\nterminal, resulting in the formation of cyclic adenosine \\nmonophosphate, which causes release of a protein kinase \\nand leads to phosphorylation of a protein that blocks \\npotassium channels in the sensory terminal.

A reticular excitatory \\narea forms descending spinal projections to the spinal \\ncord that exert an excitatory influence on motor \\nneurons that innervate antigravity musculature. This \\nsame reticular area also sends fibers rostrally to various \\nlocations, including the thalamus, where neurons \\ndistribute to all regions of the cerebral cortex.\\nTwo types of signals reach the thalamus. One type \\narises from large cholinergic reticular neurons, is rap -\\nidly transmitted, and excites the cerebrum for only a few \\nmilliseconds.

These cells have unusually \\nlong, diffusely projecting axons that extend to many \\nareas of the brain, including the thalamus and cere-\\nbral cortex. At most of its synaptic targets, norepi -\\nnephrine exerts excitatory effects, although in some \\nregions, norepinephrine produces inhibition. Often \\nthe effects of norepinephrine are modulatory. That \\nis, they might not cause an action potential in the \\ntarget neuron but instead raise the excitability level \\nof the cell, making it more likely to fire action poten-\\ntials in response to subsequent stimuli.\\n •  Most dopaminergic neurons are concentrated in two \\nlocations in the midbrain that give rise to the meso -\\nstriatal and the mesolimbic systems.

The thirst center is in the lateral \\nhypothalamus; a desire to “drink” is initiated when the \\nosmolality is elevated in the local tissues.

Slow-wave sleep is the deep, restful \\ntype of sleep characterized by decreases in peripheral \\nvascular tone, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and \\nmetabolic rate. Dreams can occur during slow-wave \\nsleep, but they are usually not remembered.\\nREM Sleep. REM sleep is called paradoxical \\nsleep because the brain is quite active and skeletal \\nmuscle contractions occur. Typically, REM sleep \\nlasts 5 to 30 minutes and repeats at about 90-minute \\nintervals. When an individual is extremely tired, \\nREM sleep may be absent, but it eventually returns \\nas the person becomes more rested. REM sleep has \\nseveral important features: (1) dreaming occurs and \\nthe dream can often be recalled, at least in part; (2) \\nwaking a person in REM sleep is more difficult, yet \\nin the morning we typically awaken during a REM \\nperiod; (3) muscle tone is substantially depressed; \\n(4) heart rate and respiration become irregular; (5) \\ndespite decreased tone, muscle contractions occur \\nin addition to rapid eye movements; and (6) brain \\nmetabolism is increased by as much as 20 percent, \\nand the electroencephalogram (EEG) shows brain \\nwaves that are characteristic of the waking state.\\nBasic Theories of Sleep (p. 764)\\nInitially, a passive theory of sleep was thought to occur \\nin which the reticular activating system promoted sleep \\nby simply decreasing its activity. This concept was chal-\\nlenged by animal experiments showing that transection \\nof the brain stem at midpontine levels resulted in an \\nanimal that never slept.

The most potent site is the raphe nuclei of \\nthe caudal pons  and medulla. Many of the neurons in \\nthe raphe nuclei use serotonin as a transmitter, and it is \\nknown that drugs that block the formation of serotonin \\nprevent sleep. In addition, stimulation in the nucleus of \\nthe solitary tract promotes sleep, but this occurs only if \\nthe raphe nuclei are also functional. Activation of the \\nsuprachiasmatic level of the hypothalamus or the mid-\\nline nuclei of the thalamus produces sleep. Some studies, \\nhowever, have shown that blood levels of serotonin are \\nlower during sleep than during wakefulness, suggesting \\nthat other substances might be involved. One possibility \\nis muramyl peptide, which accumulates in cerebrospi -\\nnal fluid and urine. When microgram amounts of this \\nsubstance are injected into the third ventricle, sleep is \\ninduced within minutes.\\nREM sleep is enhanced by cholinergic agonists. It is \\npostulated that projections of cholinergic neurons of the \\nmidbrain reticular formation are responsible for the ini-\\ntiation of REM sleep. These projections would activate \\nneurons that lead to REM sleep activation and avoid the \\nsystems that contribute to waking state production and \\nthe reticular activating system.\\nPhysiological Effects of Sleep (p. 765)\\nProlonged wakefulness (absence of sleep) is associated \\nwith sluggishness of thought, irritability, and even psy -\\nchotic behavior. Sleep restores the normal balance of \\nactivity in many parts of the brain—from the higher intel-\\nlectual centers of the cortex to the vegetative and behav -\\nioral functions of the hypothalamus and limbic system. \\nSleep deprivation affects other systems in the body that \\nregulate blood pressure, heart rate, peripheral vascular \\ntone, muscle activity, and basal metabolic rate. Again, the \\nmechanisms of these processes are poorly understood.\\nBRAIN WAVES (p. 766)\\nElectrical potentials that originate near the surface \\nof the brain and are recorded from outside the head \\nare called brain waves; the recording process is called \\nelectroencephalography.

Four major \\nbrain wave patterns have been described: alpha, beta, \\ntheta, and delta waves.\\n •  Alpha waves. Alpha waves are rhythmical waves with \\na frequency of 8 to 12 hertz at about 50 microvolts; \\nthey are found in normal persons who are awake but \\nresting (with their eyes closed).\\n •  Beta waves. When the eyes are opened in the light, \\nslightly higher frequency (14 to 80 hertz) beta waves \\nappear, with a voltage of less than 50 microvolts. \\nThalamocortical projections must be intact for these \\nwaves to be recorded; presumably, the ascending re-\\nticular input to the thalamus also must be functional.\\n •  Theta waves. Theta waves have frequencies in the \\nrange of 4 to 7 hertz and occur mainly in the parietal \\nand temporal areas in children, but they can appear \\nin adults during a period of emotional stress. They \\nalso appear in association with brain disorders and \\ndegenerative brain states.\\n •  Delta waves. Delta waves are all of the waves below \\n3.5 hertz; they occur during deep sleep, with serious \\norganic brain disease, and in infants. It appears that \\ndelta waves persist in the absence of cortical input \\nfrom the thalamus and lower brain centers. Because \\nthey can be seen during slow-wave sleep, this sleep \\nstate is probably due to releasing the cortex from the \\ninfluence of lower centers.\\nEffect of Varying Levels of Cerebral Activity on \\nthe Frequency of the EEG (p. 767)\\nAs one progresses from alert wakefulness to deep sleep, \\nthere is a gradual change in brain wave activity from low-\\nvoltage/high-frequency waves (alpha) to high-voltage/\\nlow-frequency waves (delta). These changes can also be \\ndescribed as a progression from desynchronized activity \\n(alert) to synchronous patterns (deep sleep).

Generalized tonic-\\nclonic epilepsy is the most severe variety and seems to \\nbe the result of intense discharges in many parts of the \\nbrain, including the cortex, thalamus, and brain stem. \\nInitially, generalized tonic seizures affect much of the \\nbody, followed by alternating tonic-clonic seizures. \\nThis activity may persist for 3 to 4 minutes and is fol -\\nlowed by postseizure depression of the nervous sys -\\ntem, which can leave the individual stuporous, sleepy, \\nand fatigued for several hours. EEG activity during a \\nseizure of this type shows characteristic high-voltage/\\nhigh-frequency patterns. Generalized tonic-clonic sei-\\nzures can be precipitated in susceptible individuals by \\n(1) strong emotional stimuli, (2) alkalosis caused by \\nhyperventilation, (3) drugs, (4) fever, or (5) a loud noise \\nor flashing light. In addition, brain trauma and tumors \\ncan lead to seizure activity. It is said that generalized \\ntonic-clonic seizures occur in persons predisposed to \\nabnormal electrogenic circuitry in the brain.\\n •  Absence epilepsy. Absence epilepsy is less severe \\nseizure activity during which the individual loses \\nconsciousness for 3 to 30 seconds and exhibits small \\ntwitching of muscles around the head or face, espe-\\ncially blinking of the eyes. Such activity is thought \\nto be limited to abnormal function in the thalamo -\\ncortical system. An absence seizure can sometimes \\nprogress to a generalized tonic-clonic seizure.\\n •  Focal epilepsy. Focal seizure activity can involve al -\\nmost any part of the brain and nearly always is caused \\nby some local abnormality, such as scar tissue forma-\\ntion, a tumor, ischemia, or a congenital abnormality. \\nThe typical presentation is a focal muscle twitching \\nthat progresses to involve adjacent body parts.

Autonomic neurons that secrete acetylcholine \\nare said to be cholinergic; those that secrete norepineph-\\nrine are said to be adrenergic. All preganglionic neurons \\nin the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the \\nautonomic nervous system are cholinergic. Acetylcho-\\nline and acetylcholine-like substances therefore excite \\nboth the sympathetic and parasympathetic postgangli-\\nonic neurons.\\nVirtually all postganglionic neurons of the para -\\nsympathetic nervous system secrete acetylcholine \\nand are cholinergic. Most postganglionic sympathetic \\nneurons secrete norepinephrine and are adrenergic. \\nHowever, the postganglionic sympathetic nerve fibers \\nto the sweat glands and perhaps to a few blood vessels \\nare cholinergic.\\nSynthesis and Secretion of Acetylcholine \\nand Norepinephrine by Postganglionic Nerve \\nEndings\\nAcetylcholine is synthesized in the terminal endings \\nof cholinergic nerve fibers through the combination of \\nacetyl–coenzyme A (CoA) with choline. Once released \\nby the cholinergic nerve endings, acetylcholine is rap -\\nidly degraded by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase.\\nNorepinephrine and epinephrine are synthesized \\nfrom the amino acid tyrosine. Tyrosine is converted \\nto dopa, which is then converted to dopamine; dopa-\\nmine is subsequently converted to norepinephrine. In \\nthe adrenal medulla, this reaction proceeds one step \\nfurther to transform 80 percent of the norepinephrine \\nto epinephrine. The action of norepinephrine is termi -\\nnated by reuptake into the adrenergic nerve endings \\nor by diffusion from the nerve endings into the sur-\\nrounding fluids.'),\n",

Nicotinic receptors are \\nligand-gated ion channels found in synapses between \\nthe preganglionic and postganglionic neurons of both \\nthe sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, \\nas well as in the skeletal muscle neuromuscular junction.\\nAdrenergic Receptors Are Subdivided Into Alpha and \\nBeta Receptors. There are two major types of alpha \\nreceptors, alpha 1 and alpha 2, which are linked to \\ndifferent G proteins.

The autonomic nervous system controls two \\nfunctions of the eyes: pupillary opening and focusing of \\nthe lens. Sympathetic stimulation contracts the radial \\ndilator muscle of the iris, resulting in pupillary dilation, \\nwhereas parasympathetic stimulation contracts the \\nsphincter muscle of the iris, resulting in pupillary \\nconstriction. Focusing of the lens is controlled almost \\nentirely by the parasympathetic nervous system. \\nParasympathetic excitation contracts the ciliary muscle, \\nwhich releases the tension on the suspensory ligament \\nof the lens and allows it to become more convex. This \\nchange allows the eye to focus on close objects.\\nGlands. The nasal, lacrimal, salivary, and \\ngastrointestinal glands are strongly stimulated by the \\nparasympathetic nervous system, resulting in copious \\nquantities of watery secretion. Sympathetic stimulation \\ncauses vasoconstriction of blood vessels that supply the \\nglands and in this way often reduces the rate of secretion \\nfrom these glands. Sympathetic stimulation has a direct \\neffect on glandular cells by causing formation of a \\nconcentrated secretion that contains extra enzymes and \\nmucus.\\nThe sweat glands secrete large quantities of sweat \\nwhen the sympathetic nerves are stimulated.

Sympathetic stimulation \\ncauses vasoconstriction of many of the blood vessels of \\nthe body, especially the abdominal viscera and the skin \\non the limbs.\\nArterial Pressure. Short-term control of arterial \\npressure is determined by two factors: propulsion of \\nblood by the heart and resistance to the flow of this blood \\nthrough the blood vessels. Sympathetic stimulation \\nincreases propulsion by the heart and resistance to \\nflow, which results in an increase in arterial pressure. \\nParasympathetic stimulation decreases the pumping \\nability of the heart but has little effect on peripheral \\nvascular resistance.

Most of the endodermal \\nstructures, such as the ducts of the liver, gallbladder, ureter, \\nurinary bladder, and bronchi, are inhibited by sympathetic \\nstimulation and excited by parasympathetic stimulation. \\nSympathetic stimulation also has multiple metabolic \\neffects such as release of glucose from the liver, increase \\nin blood glucose concentration, increase in glycogenolysis \\nin liver and muscle, increase in skeletal muscle strength, \\nincrease in basal metabolic rate, and increase in mental \\nactivity.

Sympathetic tone and parasympathetic tone allow \\na single division of the autonomic nervous system to \\nincrease or decrease the activity of a visceral organ or \\nto constrict or dilate a vascular bed. Normally, sympa -\\nthetic tone constricts systemic arterioles to about one \\nhalf of their maximum diameter, whereas parasympa -\\nthetic tone maintains normal gastrointestinal motility.\\nDiscrete or Mass Discharges of the Autonomic \\nNervous System (p. 783)\\nIn some instances, the sympathetic nervous system \\nbecomes very active and causes a widespread reac -\\ntion throughout the body that is called the alarm  or \\nstress response. At other times, sympathetic activation \\nor inactivation occurs in isolated areas of the body; \\nfor example, local vasodilation and sweating occur in \\nresponse to a local increase in temperature.\\nThe parasympathetic nervous system is usually \\nresponsible for highly specific changes in visceral func -\\ntion, such as changes in salivary and gastric secretion or \\nin bladder and rectal emptying. Also, parasympathetic \\ncardiovascular reflexes usually act only on the heart to \\nincrease or decrease its rate of beating and have little \\neffect on vascular resistance.\\nWidespread activation of the sympathetic nervous \\nsystem can be brought about by fear, rage, or severe \\npain. The alarm or stress response that results is often \\ncalled the fight or flight reaction. Widespread sympa-\\nthetic activation causes increases in arterial pressure, \\nmuscle blood flow, metabolic rate, blood glucose con-\\ncentration, glycogenolysis, and mental alertness and \\ndecreases in blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract and \\nkidneys and a shorter coagulation time. These effects \\nallow a person to perform far more strenuous activity \\nthan would otherwise be possible.'),\n",

Hydrogen ions induce cerebral \\nvasodilation in proportion to their concentration in \\nthe cerebral blood. Any substance that increases the \\nacidity of the brain, and therefore the hydrogen ion \\nconcentration, increases cerebral blood flow; such \\nsubstances include lactic acid, pyruvic acid, and other \\nacidic compounds that are formed during the course of \\nmetabolism.

Cerebral blood flow is \\nnearly constant between the limits of 60 and 140 mm Hg \\nmean arterial pressure. Arterial pressure therefore can \\nfall to as low as 60 mm Hg or rise to as high as 140 mm \\nHg without significant changes occurring in cerebral \\nblood flow. When arterial pressure falls below 60 mm \\nHg, cerebral blood flow is usually compromised.

The cerebral circulation \\nhas dense sympathetic innervation; under certain \\nconditions, sympathetic stimulation can cause marked \\nconstriction of the cerebral arteries. During strenuous \\nexercise or states of enhanced circulatory activity, \\nsympathetic impulses can constrict the large and \\nintermediate-sized arteries and prevent the high pressure \\nfrom reaching small blood vessels. This mechanism is \\nimportant for preventing cerebral vascular hemorrhage. \\nUnder many conditions in which the sympathetic \\nnervous system is moderately activated, however, \\ncerebral blood flow is maintained relatively constant by \\nautoregulatory mechanisms.\\nCerebral Microcirculation\\nThe density of capillaries is four times greater in the gray \\nmatter of the brain than in the white matter. The level \\nof blood flow to the gray matter is therefore four times \\nas great as that to the white matter, matching the much \\nhigher metabolic needs of gray matter.

Most of \\nthis fluid originates from the choroid plexuses of the four \\nventricles. Additional amounts of fluid are secreted by \\nthe ependymal surfaces of the ventricles and the arach-\\nnoidal membranes. The choroid plexus is a cauliflower-\\nlike growth of blood vessels covered by a thin layer of \\nepithelial cells. This structure projects into the temporal \\nhorn of each lateral ventricle, the posterior portion of the \\nthird ventricle, and the roof of the fourth ventricle.\\nThe CSF is absorbed by multiple arachnoidal villi \\nthat project into the large sagittal venous sinus, as well \\nas into other venous sinuses of the cerebrum. The CSF \\nempties into the venous blood through the surfaces of \\nthese villi.\\nThe Perivascular Space Functions as a Lymphatic \\nSystem for the Brain. As the blood vessels that supply the \\nbrain penetrate inward, they carry with them a layer \\nof pia matter. The pia is only loosely adherent to the \\nvessels, which creates a space between the pia and the \\nvessels called the perivascular space. The perivascular \\nspace follows the arteries and veins into the brain as far \\nas the arterioles and venules but not to the level of the \\ncapillaries.\\nProtein that leaks into the interstitial spaces of the \\nbrain flows through the perivascular spaces into the \\nsubarachnoid space.

Hydrocephalus caused by obstruction to \\nthe flow of CSF is often referred to as communicating \\nhydrocephalus or noncommunicating hydrocephalus.  \\nWith communicating hydrocephalus, fluid flows readily \\nfrom the ventricular system into the subarachnoid space, \\nwhereas with noncommunicating hydrocephalus, the \\nflow of fluid out of one or more of the ventricles is blocked.\\nThe communicating type of hydrocephalus is usually \\ncaused by blockage of fluid flow into the subarachnoid \\nspace around the basal regions of the brain or blockage \\nof the arachnoidal villi themselves. The noncommuni-\\ncating type of hydrocephalus is usually caused by block -\\nade of the aqueduct of Sylvius as a result of a congenital \\ndefect or brain tumor. The continual formation of CSF \\nby the choroid plexuses in the two lateral ventricles and \\nthe third ventricle causes the volume of these ventricles \\nto increase greatly, which flattens the brain into a thin \\nshell against the skull.

The membranes of \\nthe adjacent endothelial cells are tightly fused with one \\nanother rather than having extensive slit pores between \\nthem, as is the case with most other capillaries of the \\nbody. These barriers often make it impossible to achieve \\neffective concentrations of therapeutic drugs, such as \\nprotein antibodies and non–lipid-soluble compounds \\nin the CSF or parenchyma of the brain.\\nIn some areas of the hypothalamus, pineal gland, and \\narea postrema, substances diffuse with greater ease into \\nthe tissue spaces. The ease of diffusion in these areas \\nis important because they have sensory receptors that \\nrespond to specific changes in the body fluids, such as \\nchanges in osmolality and in glucose concentration, as \\nwell as receptors for peptide hormones that regulate \\nthirst, such as angiotensin II.\\nBrain Edema (p. 793)\\nOne of the most serious complications of abnormal \\ncerebral hemodynamics and fluid dynamics is the devel-\\nopment of brain edema. Because the brain is encased in \\na solid vault, accumulation of edema fluid compresses \\nthe blood vessels, resulting in decreased blood flow and \\ndestruction of brain tissue. Brain edema can be caused \\nby greatly increased capillary pressure or by a concus -\\nsion in which the brain’s tissues and capillaries are trau-\\nmatized and capillary fluid leaks into this tissue.\\nOnce brain edema begins, it sometimes initiates a \\nvicious circle. The edema fluid compresses the vascula -\\nture, which in turn decreases the blood flow and causes \\nbrain ischemia. The ischemia causes arteriolar dilation \\nwith further increases in capillary pressure. The higher \\ncapillary pressure causes more edema fluid, and the \\nedema becomes progressively worse. The reduced blood \\nflow also decreases oxygen delivery, which increases the \\npermeability of the capillaries, allowing more fluid leak-\\nage. Decreased oxygen delivery depresses brain metab -\\nolism, which turns off the sodium pumps of the brain \\ncells, causing them to swell.\\nOnce this process has begun, heroic measures must \\nbe taken to prevent total destruction of the brain. One \\nmeasure is to administer an intravenous infusion of a \\nconcentrated osmotic substance such as mannitol. \\nThis pulls fluid from the brain tissue through osmosis \\nand breaks the vicious circle. Another procedure is to \\nremove fluid quickly from the lateral ventricles of the \\nbrain through ventricular puncture, thereby relieving \\nintracerebral pressure.'),\n",

Although the \\nprecise cause or causes of increased blood flow during \\nincreased gastrointestinal activity are still unclear, some \\nfacts are known:\\n •  V asodilator substances are released from the mucosa \\nduring the digestive process.

Food is voluntarily pushed into the \\npharynx by the tongue when it is ready for swallowing; \\nthis constitutes the voluntary stage of swallowing. The \\nbolus of food stimulates swallowing receptors that \\nsend impulses to the brain stem to initiate a series of \\nautomatic pharyngeal muscle contractions, as follows:\\n •  The s oft palate is pulled upward, preventing reflux of \\nfood into the nasal cavities.\\n •  The palatopharyngeal folds on either side of the \\npharynx are pulled medially, forming a sagittal slit \\nthat impedes the passage of large objects into the \\nposterior pharynx.\\n •  The vo cal cords are strongly approximated, the lar \\xad\\nynx is pulled upward and anteriorly, and the epiglottis \\nswings backward over the opening of the larynx.

Normally, \\nwhen food enters the stomach, a vagovagal reflex from \\nthe stomach to the brain stem and then back to the \\nstomach reduces the tone in the muscular wall of the \\nstomach. The wall can bulge progressively outward, \\naccommodating about 1.5 liters in the completely \\nrelaxed stomach.\\n“Retropulsion” Is a Major Mixing Mechanism of the \\nStomach. Each time a peristaltic wave passes over \\nthe antrum toward the pylorus, the pyloric muscle \\ncontracts, which further impedes emptying through \\nthe pylorus. Most of the antral contents are squirted \\nbackward through the peristaltic ring toward the body \\nof the stomach.\\nThe Pyloric Sphincter Helps Regulate Gastric Emptying . \\nThe pyloric sphincter remains slightly contracted most \\nof the time. The constriction normally prevents passage \\nof food particles until they have become mixed in the \\nchyme to an almost fluid consistency.\\nGastric Emptying Is Inhibited by Enterogastric Reflexes \\nFrom the Duodenum . When food enters the duodenum, \\nmultiple nervous reflexes are initiated from its wall that \\npass back to the stomach and slow or even stop stomach \\nemptying as the volume of chyme in the duodenum \\nbecomes too much. The following factors can excite the \\nenterogastric reflexes:\\n •  Dist ention of the duodenum\\n •  Ir ritation of the duodenal mucosa\\n •  T oo much acidity of the duodenal chyme\\n •  High or low o smolality of chyme\\n •  The pr esence of breakdown products of proteins\\nCholecystokinin Inhibits Gastric Emptying.

Segmentation \\ncontractions are concentric contractions that have the \\nappearance of a chain of sausages. These segmentation \\ncontractions usually “chop” the chyme about two or three \\ntimes each minute, promoting progressive mixing of \\nsolid food particles with secretions of the small intestine.\\nChyme Is Propelled Through the Small Intestine by \\nPeristaltic Waves. Peristaltic waves move toward the anus \\nat a velocity of 0.5 to 2.0 cm/sec. Movement of chyme \\nalong the small intestine averages only 1 cm/min. About \\n3 to 5 hours are required for passage of chyme from the \\npylorus to the ileocecal valve.\\nPeristalsis Is Controlled by Nervous and Hormonal \\nSignals. Peristaltic activity of the small intestine is \\ngreatly increased after a meal for the following reasons:\\n •  Nervous signals. Nervous signals are caused in part \\nby the entry of chyme into the duodenum and in \\npart by the gastroenteric reflex that is initiated by \\ndistention of the stomach and conducted principally \\nthrough the myenteric plexus along the wall of the \\nsmall intestine.\\n •  Hormonal signals. Gastrin, cholecystokinin, and insu\\xad\\nlin are released after a meal and can enhance intestinal \\nmotility. Secretin and glucagon inhibit small intestinal \\nmotility. However, the quantitative importance of these \\nhormones in gastrointestinal motility is uncertain.\\nThe Ileocecal Valve Prevents Backflow of Fecal Contents \\nFrom the Colon Into the Small Intestine . The lips of the \\nileocecal valve protrude into the lumen of the cecum \\nand are forcefully closed when excess pressure builds \\nup in the cecum and the cecal contents push backward \\nagainst the lips. The wall of the ileum near the ileocecal \\nvalve has a thickened muscular coat called the ileocecal \\nsphincter. This sphincter normally remains mildly \\nconstricted and slows the emptying of ileal contents \\ninto the cecum, except immediately after a meal.\\nThe Ileocecal Sphincter and the Intensity of Peristalsis \\nin the Terminal Ileum Are Controlled by Reflexes From \\nthe Cecum. Whenever the cecum is distended, the \\ncontraction of the ileocecal sphincter is intensified \\nand ileal peristalsis is inhibited, which greatly delays \\nemptying of additional chyme from the ileum.

The proximal half of \\nthe colon is concerned principally with absorption; the \\ndistal half is concerned with storage.\\nContraction of Circular and Longitudinal Muscles in the \\nLarge Intestine Causes Haustrations to Develop . These \\ncombined contractions cause the unstimulated portion \\nof the large intestine to bulge outward into baglike sacs \\ncalled haustrations. The haustral contractions perform \\ntwo main functions:\\n •  Propulsion. Haustral contractions at times move \\nslowly toward the anus during their period of con\\xad\\ntraction and thereby provide forward propulsion of \\nthe colonic contents.\\n •  Mixing. Haustral contractions dig into and roll over \\nthe fecal material in the large intestine. In this way, \\nall the fecal material is gradually exposed to the \\nsurface of the large intestine, allowing fluid and dis\\xad\\nsolved substances to be absorbed.\\nMass Movements Propel Fecal Contents Long Distances \\nin the Large Intestine . A mass movement is characterized \\nby the following sequence of events. A constrictive ring \\noccurs at a distended or irritated point in the colon, and \\nthen the colon distal to the constriction contracts as a \\nunit, forcing the fecal material in this segment en masse \\nthrough the colon. When a mass of feces has been \\nforced into the rectum, the desire for defecation is felt.\\nThe Appearance of Mass Movements After Meals Is \\nFacilitated by Gastrocolic and Duodenocolic Reflexes . \\nThese reflexes result from distention of the stomach \\nand duodenum. The reflexes are conducted through \\nextrinsic nerves of the autonomic nervous system. \\nMass movements can also be initiated by intense \\nstimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system or \\nby overdistention of a segment of the colon.\\nDefecation Can Be Initiated by an Intrinsic Reflex \\nMediated by the Local Enteric Nervous System .

An excess \\nof sodium reabsorption creates a negative charge in \\nthe salivary ducts, causing chloride ions to be reab-\\nsorbed passively.\\n •  Bic arbonate ions are secreted into the ducts in ex -\\nchange for chloride ions and also by an active secre-\\ntory process.\\nSalivation Is Controlled Mainly by Parasympathetic \\nNervous Signals. The salivatory nuclei in the brain stem \\nare excited by taste and tactile stimuli from the tongue, \\nmouth, and pharynx. Salivation can also be affected \\nby higher centers of the brain; for example, salivation \\nincreases when a person smells favorite foods.\\nGASTRIC SECRETION (p. 821)\\nThe Stomach Mucosa Has Two Main Types of Tubular Gland . \\n •  The oxyntic (acid-forming) glands  are located in the \\nbody and fundus. They contain three types of cells: \\nmucous neck cells, which secrete mainly mucus but \\nalso some pepsinogen; peptic (chief) cells, which se-\\ncrete pepsinogen; and parietal (oxyntic) cells, which \\nsecrete hydrochloric acid and intrinsic factor.\\n •  The pyloric glands are located in the antrum. These \\nglands secrete mainly mucus for protection of the \\npyloric mucosa but also some pepsinogen and, im-\\nportantly, the hormone gastrin.\\nGastric Acid Is Secreted by Parietal Cells . When parietal \\ncells secrete their acidic juice, the membranes of the \\ninternal canaliculi of the cells empty their secretion directly \\ninto the lumen of the oxyntic gland. When secretion is high, \\nthe fluid entering the canaliculus contains concentrated \\nhydrochloric acid (155 mEq/L), potassium chloride (15 \\nmEq/L), and small amounts of sodium chloride.\\nHydrochloric Acid Is as Necessary as Pepsin for Protein \\nDigestion in the Stomach. The pepsinogens have no \\ndigestive activity when they are first secreted. However, \\nas soon as they come into contact with hydrochloric \\nacid—and especially when they come into contact with \\npreviously formed pepsin plus the hydrochloric acid—\\nthey are activated to form pepsin.'),\n",

Intrinsic \\nfactor is essential for absorption of vitamin B 12 in the \\nileum. When the acid-producing cells of the stomach \\nare destroyed, which often occurs in chronic gastritis, \\nachlorhydria and often pernicious anemia develop as a \\nresult of failure of the red blood cells to mature.\\nGastric Secretion Is Stimulated by Acetylcholine, Gastrin, \\nand Histamine. Acetylcholine stimulates the secretion of \\npepsinogen by peptic cells, hydrochloric acid by parietal \\ncells, and mucus by mucous cells. In comparison, both \\ngastrin and histamine strongly stimulate secretion of \\nacid by parietal cells but have little effect on other cells.\\nAcid Secretion Is Stimulated by Gastrin . Nerve impulses \\nfrom the vagus nerves and local enteric reflexes cause \\ngastrin cells (G cells) in the antral mucosa to secrete \\ngastrin. Gastrin is carried by blood to the oxyntic \\nglands, where it strongly stimulates parietal cells and \\npeptic cells to a lesser extent.\\nHistamine Stimulates Acid Secretion by Parietal \\nCells. Histamine stimulates gastric acid secretion in a \\nparacrine manner and has a multiplicative effect with \\nacetylcholine and gastrin. When the actions of histamine \\nare blocked, the effectiveness of the stimulation of \\nacid secretion by gastrin and acetylcholine is greatly \\ndiminished.\\nPepsinogen Secretion Is Stimulated by Acetylcholine \\nand Gastric Acid. Acetylcholine is released from vagus \\nnerves or other enteric nerves. Gastric acid probably \\ndoes not stimulate peptic cells directly but elicits \\nadditional enteric reflexes. When the ability to secrete \\nnormal amounts of acid is lost, the pepsinogen level is \\nlow even though the peptic cells are normal.\\nGastric Secretion Is Inhibited by Excess Acid in the \\nStomach. When the pH of gastric juice falls below 3.0, \\ngastrin secretion is decreased for two reasons: (1) the \\nhigh acidity stimulates the release of somatostatin from \\ndelta cells, which in turn depresses gastrin secretion by \\nthe G cells, and (2) the acid causes an inhibitory nervous \\nreflex that inhibits gastric secretion. This mechanism \\nprotects the stomach.\\nGastric Secretion Has Three Phases. \\n •  The cephalic phase accounts for 30 percent of the re-\\nsponse to a meal and is initiated by the anticipation \\nof eating and the odor and taste of food. It is medi-\\nated entirely by the vagus nerves.\\n •  The gastric phase accounts for 60 percent of the \\nacid response to a meal. It is initiated by distention \\nof the stomach, which leads to nervous stimulation \\nof gastric secretion. In addition, partial digestion '),\n",

The gas -\\ntrin then causes secretion of a highly acidic gastric \\njuice.\\n •  The intestinal phase (10 percent of the response) is \\ninitiated by nervous stimuli associated with disten-\\ntion of the small intestine. The presence of digestion \\nproducts of proteins in the small intestine can also \\nstimulate gastric secretion, possibly by release of \\ngastrin from G cells in the duodenum and jejunum.\\nChyme in the Small Intestine Inhibits Secretion During \\nthe Gastric Phase . The inhibition of secretion during the \\ngastric phase by chyme in the small intestine results \\nfrom at least two influences:\\n •  Enterogastric reflex. The presence of food in the \\nsmall intestine initiates this reflex, which is trans-\\nmitted through the enteric nervous system and \\nthrough the extrinsic sympathetic and vagus nerves; \\nthis reflex inhibits gastric secretion. The reflex can \\nbe initiated by distention of the small intestine, the \\npresence of acid in the upper intestine, the presence \\nof protein breakdown products, or irritation of the \\nmucosa.\\n •  Hormones. The presence of chyme in the upper small \\nintestine causes the release of several intestinal hor-\\nmones. Secretin and glucose-dependent insulinotro -\\npic peptide are especially important for inhibition of \\ngastric secretions.\\nPANCREATIC SECRETION (p. 825)\\nDigestive Enzymes Are Secreted by the Pancreatic Acini. \\n •  The more important enzymes for digestion of pro -\\nteins are trypsin, chymotrypsin, and carboxypoly -\\npeptidase, which are secreted in the inactive forms \\ntrypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, and procarboxy-\\npolypeptidase.\\n •  The panc reatic digestive enzyme for carbohydrates \\nis pancreatic amylase, which hydrolyzes starches, \\nglycogen, and most other carbohydrates (except \\ncellulose) to form disaccharides and a few trisac-\\ncharides.\\n •  The main enz yme for fat digestion is pancreatic li -\\npase, which hydrolyzes triglycerides into fatty acids \\nand monoglycerides; cholesterol esterase, which \\ncauses hydrolysis of cholesterol esters; and phospho-\\nlipase, which splits fatty acids from phospholipids.'),\n",

The nervous signals that cause gas -\\ntric secretion also cause acetylcholine release by va-\\ngal nerve endings in the pancreas, which accounts \\nfor about 20 percent of the pancreatic enzymes after \\na meal.\\n •  Gastric phase. The nervous stimulation of enzyme \\nsecretion continues, accounting for another 5 to 10 \\npercent of the enzymes secreted after a meal.\\n •  Intestinal phase.

The presence of food in the upper small \\nintestine also causes cholecystokinin to be released from \\nI cells in the mucosa of the duodenum, jejunum, and \\nupper ileum. This effect in particular results from the \\npresence of proteases and peptones (which are products \\nof partial protein digestion) and long-chain fatty acids; \\nhydrochloric acid from the stomach juices also causes \\ncholecystokinin release in smaller quantities.'),\n",

This low concentration of sodium provides \\na steep electrochemical gradient for sodium movement \\nfrom the chyme through the brush border and into the \\nepithelial cell cytoplasm.

Many of the chemical reactions in cells are \\nconcerned with making the energy in foods available to \\nvarious physiological systems of the cell. The substance \\nadenosine triphosphate (ATP) plays a key role in making \\nthe energy of the foods available for this purpose. ATP \\nis a labile chemical compound containing two high-\\nenergy phosphate bonds. The amount of free energy in \\neach of these phosphate bonds is approximately 12,000 \\ncalories under conditions found in the body.\\nATP is present in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm \\nof all cells. Essentially all of the physiological mecha -\\nnisms that require energy for operation obtain this \\nenergy directly from ATP (or other similar high-energy \\ncompounds, such as guanosine triphosphate). In turn, \\nthe food in cells is gradually oxidized and the released \\nenergy is used to re-form the ATP so a supply of this \\nsubstance is continually maintained.

These monosaccharides cannot diffuse \\nthrough the usual pores in the cell membrane. To enter \\nthe cell, these monosaccharides combine with pro-\\ntein carriers in the membrane that allow them to pass \\nthrough the membrane via facilitated diffusion into the \\ncell, as discussed in Chapter 4. After passing through \\nthe membrane, the monosaccharides become dissoci-\\nated from the carriers.\\nInsulin Facilitates Diffusion of Glucose . The rate of \\nglucose transport through the cell membranes is \\ngreatly increased by insulin.

Phosphorylation of glucose is almost com -\\npletely irreversible, except in liver cells, renal tubular \\nepithelium, and intestinal epithelial cells, where glucose \\nphosphatase is available for reversing the reaction.

All cells of the body are capable of glycogen-\\nesis and storing some glycogen, but liver and muscle \\ncells can store large quantities of it. The glycogen mol-\\necule can be polymerized to form very large molecules \\nwith an average molecular weight of 5 million. These \\nlarge glycogen molecules precipitate to form solid \\ngranules.\\nGlycogenolysis Is the Process of Glycogen Formation . \\nGlycogenolysis is not the reverse process of glycogenesis. \\nIn glycogenolysis, the glucose molecule on each branch \\nof the glycogen polymer is split away by the process \\nof phosphorylation, which is catalyzed by the enzyme \\nphosphorylase.\\nUnder resting conditions, the phosphorylase enzyme \\nis inactive.

This \\ncontrol is accomplished by a feedback mechanism \\nrelated to the concentrations of ADP and ATP .\\nOne important way in which ATP helps control \\nenergy metabolism is allosteric inhibition of the \\nenzyme phosphofructokinase. This enzyme promotes \\nformation of fructose-1,6-diphosphate during the  \\ninitial steps of glycolysis. The net effect of excess cel-\\nlular ATP is to stop glycolysis, which in turn stops \\nmost carbohydrate metabolism. Conversely, ADP \\ncauses the opposite allosteric change in this enzyme, \\ngreatly increasing its activity. Whenever ATP is \\nused by the tissues for energy, ATP inhibition of the \\nenzyme is reduced, but at the same time its activity is \\nincreased as a result of the ADP that is formed. The \\nglycolytic process is thus set in motion. When cellular \\nstores of ATP are replenished, the enzyme is again \\ninhibited.\\nANAEROBIC RELEASE OF ENERGY—ANAEROBIC \\nGLYCOLYSIS (p. 860)\\nIf oxygen becomes either unavailable or insufficient, \\ncellular oxidation of glucose cannot take place. Under \\nthese conditions, a small amount of energy can still \\nbe released to the cells through glycolysis because the \\nchemical reactions in the glycolytic breakdown of glu-\\ncose to pyruvic acid do not require oxygen. The process \\nof anaerobic glycolysis is extremely wasteful of glucose \\nbecause only 24,000 calories of energy are used to form \\nATP for each mole of glucose, representing a little over \\n3 percent of the total energy in the glucose molecule. \\nHowever, this release of glycolytic energy to the cells can \\nbe a lifesaving measure for a few minutes when oxygen \\nis unavailable.\\nFormation of Lactic Acid During Anaerobic Glycolysis \\nAllows Release of Extra Anaerobic Energy . The end \\nproducts of the glycolytic reactions—pyruvic acid and \\nnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)—combine \\nunder the influence of the enzyme lactic dehydrogenase \\nto form lactic acid and NAD + . This prevents buildup \\nof pyruvic acid and NADH, which would inhibit the \\nglycolytic reactions. The lactic acid that is formed \\nreadily diffuses out of the cells into the extracellular \\nfluids. Lactic acid represents a “sinkhole” into which \\nthe glycolytic end products can disappear, allowing \\nglycolysis to proceed far longer than would otherwise \\nbe possible.'),\n",

Fatty acids are actually large polymers \\nof the acetyl portion of acetyl-CoA, so it is not difficult \\nto understand how acetyl-CoA can be converted to fatty \\nacids.\\nFatty Acids Combine With α-Glycerophosphate to Form \\nTriglycerides. Once the synthesized fatty acid chains have \\ngrown to contain 14 to 18 carbon atoms, they bind with \\nglycerol to form triglycerides. The enzymes that cause \\nthis conversion are highly specific for fatty acids, with \\nchain lengths of 14 carbon atoms or greater, a factor that \\ncontrols the physical quality of the triglycerides stored \\nin the body.\\nThe glycerol portion of the triglyceride is furnished \\nby α-glycerophosphate, which is also a product of the \\nglycolytic breakdown of glucose. The importance of this \\nmechanism in the formation of triglycerides is that the \\nfinal combination of fatty acids with glycerol is controlled \\nmainly by the concentration of α-glycerophosphate, \\nwhich in turn is determined by the availability of carbo-\\nhydrates. When carbohydrates form large quantities of \\nα-glycerophosphate, the equilibrium shifts to promote \\nformation and storage of triglycerides. When carbohy-\\ndrates are not available, the process shifts in the oppo -\\nsite direction; the excess fatty acids become available to \\nsubstitute for the lack of carbohydrate metabolism.\\nFat Synthesis From Carbohydrates Is Important . Fat \\nsynthesis from carbohydrates is especially important \\nbecause the various cells of the body have limited \\ncapacity for storing carbohydrates in the form of \\nglycogen. The average person has about 150 times as \\nmuch energy stored as fat as is stored as carbohydrate. \\nStorage of energy in the form of fat is also important \\nbecause each gram of fat contains approximately two '),\n",

For a given weight gain, a person \\ncan store far more energy in the form of fat than in the \\nform of carbohydrate.\\nSynthesis of Triglycerides From Proteins (p. 869)\\nMany amino acids can be converted to acetyl-CoA, \\nwhich subsequently can be converted to triglycerides. \\nWhen more protein is available in the diet than can be \\nused as protein or directly for energy, a large share of the \\nexcess energy is stored as fat.\\nRegulation of Energy Release From Triglycerides \\n(p. 869)\\nCarbohydrates Are Preferred Over Fats for Energy When \\nExcess Carbohydrates Are Available. Excess carbohydrates \\nin the diet have a “fat-sparing” effect and are used \\npreferentially for energy. One reason for this is that excess \\ncarbohydrates result in increased α-glycerophosphate, \\nwhich binds free fatty acids and increases stored \\ntriglycerides. Metabolism of excess carbohydrates also \\nresults in increased synthesis of acetyl-CoA, which is \\nconverted to fatty acids. Thus, excess amounts of dietary \\ncarbohydrates not only have a fat-sparing effect, they \\nalso increase fat stores.\\nConversely, when carbohydrates are not available, \\nfat is mobilized from adipocytes and used in place of \\ncarbohydrates.\\nHormonal Regulation of Fat Utilization. Several hormones  \\nsecreted by the endocrine system, in addition to insulin \\n(discussed elsewhere), have marked effects on fat \\nutilization:\\n •  Epinephrine and norepinephrine released by the ad -\\nrenal medulla dramatically increase fat utilization \\nduring heavy exercise. These two hormones directly \\nactivate hormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase,  which \\nis present in abundance in fat cells. The activated \\nhormone causes rapid breakdown of triglycerides \\nand mobilization of fatty acids. Other stressors that \\nactivate the sympathetic nervous system similarly \\nincrease fatty acid mobilization and utilization.\\n •  Corticotropin is released by the anterior pituitary \\ngland in response to stress and causes the adrenal \\ncortex to secrete glucocorticoids (cortisol). Both \\ncorticotropin and the glucocorticoids activate  \\nhormone-sensitive triglyceride lipase, which in-\\ncreases release of fatty acids from fat tissue.'),\n",

Growth \\nhormone can also have a mild fat-mobilizing effect. A \\nlack of insulin activates hormone-sensitive lipase and \\ncauses rapid mobilization of fatty acids. When carbo-\\nhydrates are not available in the diet, insulin secretion \\ndiminishes, which promotes fatty acid metabolism.\\n •  Thyroid hormone causes rapid mobilization of fat. \\nThis process is believed to result indirectly from an \\nincreased rate of energy metabolism in all the cells of \\nthe body under the influence of this hormone.\\nPHOSPHOLIPIDS AND CHOLESTEROL (p. 870)\\nPhospholipids. The three major types of phospholipid in \\nthe body are lecithins, cephalins, and sphingomyelins. \\nPhospholipids are used throughout the body for \\nvarious structural purposes; they are an important \\nconstituent of lipoproteins in the blood and are \\nessential for the formation and function of these \\ncompounds. The absence of phospholipids can cause \\nserious abnormalities in the transport of cholesterol \\nand other lipids. Thromboplastin, which is needed to \\ninitiate the clotting process, is composed mainly of one \\nof the cephalins. Large quantities of sphingomyelins \\nare present in the nervous system; this substance acts \\nas an insulator in the myelin sheath around the nerve \\nfibers. Perhaps the most important function of the \\nphospholipids is participation in the formation of \\nthe structural elements, mainly membranes, in cells \\nthroughout the body.\\nCholesterol. Cholesterol is present in all diets and is \\nabsorbed slowly from the gastrointestinal tract into the \\nintestinal lymph. In addition to the cholesterol absorbed \\neach day from the gastrointestinal tract (exogenous \\ncholesterol), a large quantity is formed in the cells of \\nthe body (endogenous cholesterol). Essentially all of the \\nendogenous cholesterol that circulates in lipoproteins \\nin the plasma is formed by the liver. Cholesterol is a \\nstructural component in cell membranes.\\nBy far the most abundant nonmembranous use of \\ncholesterol in the body is for the formation of cholic \\nacid in the liver; about 80 percent of the cholesterol \\nis converted to cholic acid. Cholic acid is conjugated \\nwith other substances to form bile salts, which promote \\ndigestion and absorption of fats.\\nA small quantity of cholesterol is used by (1) the \\nadrenal glands to form adrenal cortical hormones,   '),\n",

Arteriosclerosis, in contrast, is a general \\nterm that refers to thickened and stiffened blood vessels \\nof all sizes.\\nDamage to the vascular endothelial cells occurs early \\nin atherosclerosis, decreasing their ability to release \\nnitric oxide and other substances that help prevent \\nadhesion of macromolecules, platelets, and mono-\\ncytes to the endothelium. After damage of the vascular \\nendothelium, circulating monocytes and lipids (mostly \\nLDLs) begin to accumulate at the site of injury. The \\nmonocytes cross the endothelium and differentiate to \\nbecome macrophages, which then ingest and oxidize \\nthe accumulated lipoproteins, giving the macrophages \\na foamlike appearance. These macrophage foam cells  \\nthen aggregate on the blood vessel and form a visible \\nfatty streak.\\nAs the fatty streaks grow larger, the surrounding \\nfibrous and smooth muscle tissues proliferate to form \\nlarger plaques, a process exacerbated by release of \\ninflammatory substances from the macrophages. As the \\nplaque bulges into the lumen of the artery it can greatly \\nreduce blood flow, sometimes even causing complete \\nvessel occlusion. Even without occlusion, the fibroblasts \\nof the plaque eventually deposit such extensive amounts \\nof dense connective tissue that sclerosis (fibrosis) is \\nsevere and the arteries become stiff and unyielding.\\nIncreased Blood LDLs Can Cause Atherosclerosis . An \\nimportant factor causing atherosclerosis is a high blood \\nplasma concentration of cholesterol in the form of LDLs. \\nThe plasma concentration of these high-cholesterol \\nLDLs is increased by several factors, including a highly \\nsaturated fat in the daily diet, obesity, and physical \\ninactivity.\\nFamilial Hypercholesterolemia Can Cause Atherosclerosis. \\nWhen a person inherits defective genes for the formation \\nof LDL receptors on the membrane surfaces of the body’s \\ncells, the liver cannot absorb either the intermediate-\\ndensity lipoproteins or the LDLs. Without this absorption, \\nthe cholesterol machinery of the liver cells goes on a \\nrampage of producing new cholesterol and VLDLs, which \\nare released into the plasma.'),\n",

HDLs are believed \\nto absorb cholesterol crystals that are beginning to \\ndeposit in the arterial walls. Consequently, when a \\nperson has a high ratio of HDL/LDL, the likelihood of \\ndeveloping atherosclerosis is reduced.\\nOther Major Risk Factors for Atherosclerosis. Some of \\nthe factors known to predispose to atherosclerosis are \\n(1) physical inactivity and obesity, (2) diabetes mellitus, \\n(3) hypertension, (4) hyperlipidemia, and (5) cigarette \\nsmoking.\\nSeveral of these risk factors occur together in many \\noverweight and obese patients, greatly increasing their \\nrisk for atherosclerosis, which in turn may lead to heart \\nattack, stroke, and kidney disease. Some of these factors \\ncause atherosclerosis by increasing the concentration of \\nLDLs in the plasma. Others, such as hypertension, lead \\nto atherosclerosis by causing damage to the vascular \\nendothelium and other changes in the vascular tissues \\nthat predispose to cholesterol deposition.\\nPrevention of Atherosclerosis. The most important \\nmeasures for reducing the risk of developing \\natherosclerosis and its progression to serious vascular \\ndisease are (1) maintaining a healthy weight, being \\nphysically active, and eating a diet that contains mainly \\nunsaturated fat with low cholesterol content; (2) \\npreventing hypertension or effectively controlling blood \\npressure with antihypertensive drugs if hypertension \\ndoes develop; (3) effectively controlling blood glucose \\nwith insulin treatment or other drugs if diabetes \\ndevelops; and (4) avoiding cigarette smoking.\\nSeveral drugs that lower plasma lipids and cho -\\nlesterol have also proved valuable for preventing \\natherosclerosis. One group of drugs, called statins, \\ncompetitively inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl–coenzyme \\nA reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of \\ncholesterol. This inhibition decreases cholesterol syn-\\nthesis and increases LDL receptors in the liver, usually \\ncausing a 25 to 50 percent reduction in the plasma lev-\\nels of LDLs. Studies generally show that for each 1 mg/\\ndl decrease in LDL cholesterol in the plasma, there is \\nabout a 2 percent decrease in mortality from atheroscle-\\nrotic heart disease. Therefore, appropriate preventive \\nmeasures are valuable for decreasing the risk for serious \\nvascular disease.'),\n",

A major function of albumin is \\nto provide colloid osmotic pressure in the plasma. The \\nglobulins are mainly responsible for immunity against \\ninvading organisms. Fibrinogen polymerizes into long, \\nbranching fibrin threads during blood coagulation, \\nthereby forming blood clots that help repair leaks in the \\ncirculatory system.\\nPlasma Proteins Form in the Liver . Essentially all of \\nthe albumin and fibrinogen and 50 to 80 percent of \\nthe globulins are formed in the liver. The remaining \\nglobulins (mainly γ-globulins in antibodies) are formed \\nin lymphoid tissue. The rate of plasma protein formation \\nby the liver can be as much as 30 grams per day. The \\nrapid production of plasma proteins by the liver is \\nvaluable in preventing death from conditions such as \\nthose found with severe burns, which cause the loss \\nof many liters of plasma through the denuded areas of \\nthe skin, and severe renal disease, in which as much as  \\n20 grams of plasma protein per day can be lost in urine.\\nWhen the tissues become depleted of proteins, the \\nplasma proteins can act as a source for rapid replace -\\nment. Whole plasma proteins can be absorbed by the \\nliver, split into amino acids, transported back into the \\nblood, and used throughout the body to build cellular \\nproteins. In this way, the plasma proteins function as a \\nlabile storage medium and represent a rapidly available \\nsource of amino acids.\\nEssential and Nonessential Amino Acids. Of the 20 \\namino acids normally present in animal proteins, 10 \\ncan be synthesized in the cells; the other 10 amino \\nacids either cannot be synthesized or are synthesized '),\n",

Synthesis \\nof the nonessential amino acids depends on the \\nformation of the appropriate α-keto acid precursor of \\nthe respective amino acid. Pyruvic acid, which is formed \\nin large quantities during the glycolytic breakdown of \\nglucose, is the α-keto acid precursor of the amino acid \\nalanine.\\nProteins Can Be Used for Energy. Once the protein \\nstores of the cell are full, additional amino acids in \\nthe body fluids are degraded and used for energy or \\nstored mainly as fat or glycogen. This degradation \\noccurs almost entirely in the liver. The first step in \\nthe degradation process is removal of amino groups \\nthrough the process of deamination, which generates \\nthe specific α-keto acid that can enter into the citric acid \\ncycle. The amount of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) \\nformed from each gram of protein oxidized is slightly \\nless than that formed from each gram of glucose. The \\nammonia released during deamination is removed from \\nthe blood almost entirely through conversion to urea \\nby the liver. In the absence of the liver or with severe \\nliver disease, ammonia accumulates in the blood. The \\nammonia is highly toxic, especially to the brain, and \\noften leads to the state of hepatic coma.\\nObligatory Degradation of Proteins . When the diet \\ncontains no proteins, a certain proportion of the \\nproteins of the body continue to be degraded into amino \\nacids. These amino acids are deaminated and oxidized; \\nthe process involves 20 to 30 grams of protein per day \\nand is called the obligatory loss of proteins. To prevent \\na net loss of proteins from the body, one must ingest \\nat least 20 to 30 grams of protein per day, although this \\namount depends on several factors, including muscle \\nmass, activity, and age; to ensure adequate protein, a \\nminimum of 60 to 75 grams per day of dietary protein is \\nusually recommended.\\nHORMONAL REGULATION OF PROTEIN \\nMETABOLISM (p. 880)\\nGrowth Hormone Increases Synthesis of Cellular Proteins, \\nCausing Tissue Proteins to Increase .

Growth hormone increases fat liberation \\nfrom fat depots, which reduces oxidation of amino acids \\nand subsequently increases the quantity of amino acids \\navailable for synthesis into proteins.\\nInsulin Accelerates Transport of Amino Acids Into Cells . \\nInsulin deficiency reduces protein synthesis to almost \\nzero. It also increases the availability of glucose to cells, \\nso use of amino acids for energy is correspondingly \\nreduced.\\nGlucocorticoids Decrease the Quantity of Proteins in \\nMost Tissues and Increase the Amino Acid Concentration \\nin Plasma.

The mechanism \\nof this effect is not known, but it is different from the \\neffect of growth hormone. Growth hormone causes \\ntissues to continue growing almost indefinitely, whereas \\ntestosterone causes the muscles and other protein \\ntissues to enlarge only for several months. Beyond \\nthis time, despite the continued administration of \\ntestosterone, further protein deposition ceases.\\nEstrogen Causes Slight Deposition of Protein . The effect \\nof estrogen is relatively insignificant compared with that \\nof testosterone.\\nThyroxine Increases Metabolism of Cells and Indirectly \\nAffects Protein Metabolism . If insufficient carbohydrates \\nand fats are available for energy, thyroxine causes rapid \\ndegradation of proteins for energy. If adequate quantities \\nof carbohydrates and fats are available, the excess amino \\nacids are used to increase the rate of protein synthesis.\\nA deficiency of thyroxine causes growth to be greatly \\ninhibited because of a lack of protein synthesis. It is \\nbelieved that thyroxine has little specific direct effect on \\nprotein metabolism but does have an important general \\neffect on increasing the rates of both normal anabolic \\nand normal catabolic protein reactions.'),\n",

The liver can remove excess glucose \\nfrom the blood and store it as glycogen. When blood \\nglucose levels begin to fall, the liver can convert the gly\\xad\\ncogen back to glucose, which is called the glucose buffer \\nfunction of the liver.

Although almost all cells in the body \\nmetabolize fat, certain aspects of fat metabolism occur \\nmainly in the liver:\\n •  β-Oxidation of fats to acetyl-coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) \\noccurs rapidly in the liver.

When the heme portion of \\nhemoglobin is metabolized, a substance called biliver-\\ndin is formed; this substance is rapidly reduced to biliru-\\nbin, which immediately combines with plasma albumin. \\nThis combination of plasma albumin and bilirubin is \\ncalled free bilirubin.\\nFree bilirubin is absorbed by hepatic cells, where it \\nis released from plasma albumin and conjugated with \\neither glucuronide to form bilirubin glucuronide or sul\\xad\\nfate to form bilirubin sulfate. The conjugated forms of \\nbilirubin are excreted in bile into the intestine, where \\nthey are converted through bacterial action to urobilino-\\ngen. Urobilinogen is highly soluble, and some of the \\nurobilinogen is reabsorbed by the intestinal mucosa \\ninto the blood. About 5 percent of the urobilinogen \\nabsorbed in this way is excreted in urine by the kidneys; \\nthe remaining urobilinogen is re \\xadexcreted by the liver \\n(Figure 71–1).\\nJaundice Represents an Excess of Either Free or Con\\xad\\njugated Bilirubin in the Extracellular Fluid . Jaundice can be \\ncaused by (1) increased destruction of red blood cells \\n(i.e., hemolytic jaundice) or (2) obstruction of the bile \\nducts or damage to the liver cells so bilirubin cannot be \\nexcreted into the gastrointestinal tract (i.e., obstructive \\njaundice).\\nWith hemolytic jaundice, the excretory function of \\nthe liver is not impaired, but red blood cells are hemo \\xad\\nlyzed so rapidly that the hepatic cells cannot excrete the \\nbilirubin as fast as it is formed. Thus, the plasma con \\xad\\ncentration of free bilirubin rises to levels much above \\nnormal. With obstructive jaundice, bile ducts may be \\nobstructed by gallstones or cancer, or the hepatic cells \\nmay be damaged, as with hepatitis. The rates of biliru\\xad\\nbin formation and conjugation of bilirubin by the liver \\nare near normal, but conjugated bilirubin cannot pass \\ninto the intestines. With obstructive jaundice the level \\nof conjugated bilirubin in the blood rises, so most of the \\nbilirubin in the plasma is the conjugated form rather \\nthan the free form.'),\n",

When a person is overfed and \\nintake of energy persistently exceeds expenditure, most \\nof the excess energy is stored as fat, and body weight \\nincreases; conversely, loss of body mass and starvation \\noccur when energy intake is insufficient to meet the \\nbody’s metabolic needs.\\nEnergy Is Available in Carbohydrates, Fats, and Proteins. \\nThe approximate energy liberated from each gram of \\ncarbohydrate as it is oxidized to carbon dioxide and \\nwater is 4.1 calories. The amount of energy liberated \\nfrom fat is 9.3 calories per gram, and the amount from \\nprotein is 4.35 calories per gram.\\nAlthough considerable variation exists among indi -\\nviduals, the usual diet of North Americans provides \\nabout 15 percent of their energy from protein, 40 per-\\ncent from fat, and 45 percent from carbohydrates. In \\nnon-Western diets, fats comprise only 15 to 20 percent \\nof the total energy consumed.\\nThe Average Daily Protein Requirement is 30 to 50 Grams. \\nAbout 20 to 30 grams of protein per day are degraded \\nby the body to manufacture other compounds; thus,  \\nall cells must continue to form new proteins to take \\nthe place of those being destroyed. The average person \\ncan maintain normal protein stores when consuming \\n30 to 50 grams of protein per day, although an average \\ndaily intake of 65 to 70 grams of protein is generally \\nrecommended.\\nSome proteins have inadequate amounts of certain \\nessential amino acids and cannot replace the degraded \\nproteins. Proteins that lack the essential amino acids are \\ncalled partial proteins. For example, cornmeal lacks the \\namino acid tryptophan. A person consuming cornmeal \\nas his or her only source of protein develops a protein-\\ndeficient syndrome called kwashiorkor, which consists \\nof failure to grow, depressed mentality, and low plasma \\nprotein that, in turn, leads to severe edema.\\nCHAPTER 72\\nDietary Balances; Regulation of Feeding; \\nObesity and Starvation; Vitamins and \\nMinerals'),\n",

When carbohydrates are \\nmetabolized with oxygen, one carbon dioxide molecule \\nis formed for every molecule of oxygen consumed, and \\nthe respiratory quotient (RQ) is therefore 1.0. When fat \\nis metabolized with oxygen, 7 carbon dioxide molecules \\nare formed for every 10 molecules of oxygen consumed, \\nso the RQ for fat metabolism is 0.70.

A person metabolizing \\nmostly fat would have an RQ close to 0.70, whereas a \\nperson metabolizing mostly carbohydrates would have \\nan RQ close to 1.0.\\nNitrogen Excretion Can Be Used to Assess Protein \\nMetabolism. The average protein contains about 16 \\npercent nitrogen. During protein metabolism, about \\n90 percent of this nitrogen is excreted in urine in the \\nform of urea and creatinine. The remaining 10 percent is \\nexcreted in feces. The amount of protein breakdown (in \\ngrams) can be estimated by measuring the amount of \\nnitrogen in urine, adding 10 percent for fecal excretion, \\nand multiplying by 6.25 (100/16). Therefore, excretion \\nof 8 grams of nitrogen in the urine each day means that \\nabout 55 grams of protein have been broken down.\\nIf the daily intake of protein is less than the daily \\nbreakdown of protein, the person is said to have a nega-\\ntive nitrogen balance, which indicates that the body \\nstores of protein are decreasing.\\nREGULATION OF FOOD INTAKE AND ENERGY \\nSTORAGE (p. 889)\\nOnly about 27 percent of the energy ingested normally \\nreaches the functional systems of the cells. Much of \\nthis is eventually converted to heat generated by pro-\\ntein metabolism, muscle activity, and activities of the \\nvarious organs and tissues of the body. Energy intake \\nin excess of that needed to perform body functions is \\nstored mainly as fat. A deficit of energy intake will cause \\nconsumption of stored energy until the energy expendi-\\nture equals energy intake, or until death occurs. Main-\\ntenance of an adequate energy supply in the body is so \\ncritical that multiple short-term and long-term control \\nsystems exist that regulate not only food intake, but also \\nenergy expenditure and energy stores.'),\n",

Distention of \\nthe stomach and duodenum causes inhibitory signals \\nto be transmitted to the feeding center by way of the \\nvagi, reducing the desire for food. The gastrointestinal \\nhormone CCK, which is released in response to fat \\nentering the duodenum, activates receptors on local \\nsensory nerves in the duodenum, thus sending messages \\nto the brain (via the vagus nerve) that contribute to \\nsatiation and meal cessation. The effect of CCK is short \\nlived, and chronic administration of CCK by itself has no \\nmajor effect on body weight. Therefore, CCK functions \\nmainly to prevent overeating during meals but may not \\nplay a major role in the frequency of meals or the total \\nenergy consumed.\\nIntermediate and Long-Term Regulation of Food Intake \\nMay Be Related to the Concentration of Glucose, Lipids, \\nand Amino Acids in the Blood and Hormones Released \\nFrom Adipose Tissue. An increase or a decrease in blood \\nconcentration of nutrients causes a corresponding \\ndecrease or increase in food intake. Our knowledge of \\nthe long-term regulation of food intake is imprecise, but \\nin general, when energy stores of the body fall below \\nnormal, the feeding centers become active. When \\nenergy stores are adequate (mainly the fat store), the \\nsatiety centers become active and a person loses the \\ndesire for food.\\nExperimental studies suggest that the hypothalamus \\nsenses energy storage, in part, through the actions of \\nleptin, a peptide hormone released from adipocytes. \\nWhen the amount of adipose tissue increases (signaling \\nexcess energy storage), the adipocytes produce increased \\namounts of leptin, which is released into the blood and \\nacts at multiple sites in the hypothalamus. Leptin espe -\\ncially activates the POMC neurons and inhibits NPY \\nneurons of the arcuate nuclei, and both of these actions \\nreduce food intake. In mice, rats, or humans with muta-\\ntions that render their fat cells unable to produce leptin \\nor mutations that cause defective leptin receptors in the \\nhypothalamus, marked hyperphagia and morbid obe-\\nsity occur. However, leptin gene mutations are rare, and \\nmost obese persons have high levels of leptin. There -\\nfore, failure of elevated leptin levels to suppress appetite \\nin obese persons has been suggested to be related, at \\nleast partially, to “resistance” of the hypothalamus to the \\nanorexigenic actions of leptin.'),\n",

A sur -\\nrogate marker for body fat content is the body mass \\nindex (BMI), which is calculated as BMI = weight (kg)/\\nheight (m2). In clinical terms, a person with a BMI \\nbetween 25.0 and 29.9 kg/m 2 is considered to be over -\\nweight, and one with a BMI greater than 30 kg/m 2 is \\nobese. However, BMI is not a direct estimate of adipos-\\nity and does not take into account the fact that some \\npersons may have a high BMI resulting from a large \\nmuscle mass.\\nObesity Results From a Greater Energy Intake Than \\nEnergy Expenditure. Excess caloric intake results in an \\nincrease in fat stores and a corresponding increase in \\nbody weight. For each 9.3 calories of excess energy that \\nenters the body, 1 gram of fat is stored. Once a person \\nbecomes obese and a stable weight is obtained, energy \\nintake once again equals energy output. For a person to \\nreduce body weight, energy intake must be less than the \\nenergy expenditure.\\nThe causes of obesity are complex and poorly under-\\nstood. Although genes play an important role in deter -\\nmining food intake or energy metabolism, low physical \\nactivity caused by a sedentary lifestyle and other envi-\\nronmental factors may play the dominant role in many \\nobese people, as evidenced by the rapid increase in the \\nprevalence of obesity during the past 20 to 30 years.\\nInanition, Anorexia, Cachexia, and  \\nStarvation (p. 896)\\nInanition is the opposite of obesity and is characterized \\nby extreme weight loss. It can be caused by inadequate \\nfood availability or by pathophysiological conditions \\nthat greatly decrease the desire for food, including psy-\\nchogenic disturbances, hypothalamic abnormalities, \\nand factors released from peripheral tissues. In persons \\nwith serious diseases such as cancer, a reduced desire \\nfor food may also be associated with increased energy \\nexpenditure, causing serious weight loss.\\nAnorexia is a reduction in food intake caused pri-\\nmarily by diminished appetite. Anorexia can occur in \\ndiseases such as cancer, when other common problems, \\nsuch as pain and nausea, may cause a person to con-\\nsume less food. Anorexia nervosa is an abnormal psy-\\nchic state in which a person loses desire for food and \\neven becomes nauseated by it; as a result, severe inani-\\ntion occurs.'),\n",

For example, \\ninflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor–α \\nthat are released by cancerous tissues cause anorexia \\nand cachexia in part by activation of POMC neurons in \\nthe hypothalamus.\\nStarvation results when food intake is chronically \\ninsufficient to meet the metabolic needs of the body. \\nDuring starvation, the body’s energy stores are depleted \\nat different rates. Carbohydrate stores (glycogen) are \\ndepleted within 12 to 24 hours. Fat, which is the main \\nsource of energy during starvation, is depleted at a con-\\nstant rate. Proteins are used rapidly at first as they are \\nconverted to glucose through the process of gluconeo-\\ngenesis. As starvation continues and the readily available \\nstores of protein are exhausted, the rate of gluconeogen-\\nesis is reduced to about one fourth its previous rate, and \\nthe rate of protein depletion is greatly reduced.\\nWhen almost all the available fat stores become \\ndepleted, the rate of protein utilization increases \\nas the proteins become the only remaining energy \\nsource.

Perhaps the most important function of \\nvitamin B12 is its ability to act as a coenzyme for reduc -\\ning ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides, a step \\nnecessary for the replication of genes. Vitamin B12 is \\nimportant for red blood cell formation, growth, and \\nmaturation. Vitamin B12 deficiency leads to poor growth \\nand pernicious anemia, a type of anemia caused by failure \\nof red blood cell maturation.\\nVitamin B12 deficiency is not caused by lack of this \\nsubstance in foods but, rather, by a deficiency of intrin-\\nsic factor.

Ascorbic acid activates the enzyme prolyl \\nhydroxylase, which promotes the hydroxylation step \\nin formation of hydroxyproline, an integral component \\nof collagen. Without ascorbic acid, collagen fibers are \\ndefective and weak. This vitamin is essential for the \\ngrowth and strength of collagen fibers in subcutaneous \\ntissue, cartilage, bone, and teeth. Deficiency of ascorbic \\nacid (scurvy) results in failure of wounds to heal, \\ninhibition of bone growth, and petechial hemorrhages \\nthroughout the body.\\nVitamin D Increases Calcium Absorption From the \\nGastrointestinal Tract and Helps Control Calcium Deposition \\nin Bone.

Heat is the end product of almost all \\nof the energy released in the body. On average, 35 per-\\ncent of the energy in foods becomes heat during ATP \\nformation. More energy becomes heat as it is transferred \\nfrom ATP to the functional systems of the body. Under \\nthe best conditions, approximately 27 percent of all the \\nenergy from food is used by the functional systems, and \\nalmost all of this energy eventually becomes heat. The \\nonly significant exception is when muscles are used to \\nperform some form of work outside the body, such as \\nelevating an object or walking up steps. In these cases, \\na potential energy is created by elevating the object (or \\nmass) against gravity. When external expenditure of \\nenergy is not taking place, all the energy released by the \\nmetabolic processes eventually becomes body heat.\\nThe calorie is the unit used for expressing the quan-\\ntity of energy released from foods or expended by the \\nfunctional processes of the body. The gram calorie is the \\nquantity of heat required to increase the temperature \\nof 1 gram of water 1°C. The gram calorie is too small a \\nunit for ease of expression when speaking of energy in \\nthe body, so the “large calorie” (sometimes spelled with \\na capital “C” and often called the kilocalorie, which is \\nequivalent to 1000 calories) is the unit ordinarily used \\nwhen discussing energy metabolism.\\nMeasurement of Metabolic Rate. Because a person \\nis ordinarily not performing external work, the whole \\nbody metabolic rate can be determined by measuring \\nthe total quantity of heat liberated from the body within \\na given time. Direct calorimetry, which measures the \\nquantity of heat liberated in a specially constructed \\nchamber, is difficult to perform and is used mainly for \\nresearch purposes. Other indirect methods are therefore \\nused to determine the metabolic rate. One of the most \\naccurate indirect methods is to determine the rate of \\noxygen utilization.

With this equivalent, one can \\ncalculate the rate of heat liberated in the body from the \\nquantity of oxygen used during a given period.\\nBasal Metabolic Rate Is the Minimum Energy Expenditure \\nRequired for the Body to Exist. The basal metabolic rate is \\na measure of the inherent metabolic rate of the tissues \\nindependent of exercise or other extraneous factors; it is \\nthe rate of energy utilization in the body during absolute \\nrest while the person is awake. The usual method for \\ndetermining the basal metabolic rate is to measure \\nthe rate of oxygen utilization during a given period. \\nThe basal metabolic rate is then calculated in terms of \\ncalories per hour. The basal metabolic rate normally \\naverages about 60 Calories/hour in young men and \\nabout 53 Calories/hour in young women. To correct for \\nbody size, the basal metabolic rate is normally expressed \\nin proportion to the body surface area, which allows \\ncomparison of basal metabolic rates among individuals \\nof different sizes.\\nFactors That Affect the Metabolic Rate\\nWhen an average 70-kg man lies in bed all day, he uses \\napproximately 1650 Calories of energy. The perfor -\\nmance of other basic functions, such as sitting in a chair \\nand eating, increases the amount of energy used. The \\ndaily energy requirement for simply existing (i.e., per-\\nforming essential functions only) is about 2000 Calo -\\nries/day.\\nSeveral factors can raise or lower the metabolic rate. \\nThe metabolic rate increases after a meal is ingested; this \\nis mainly the result of the stimulatory effect of amino \\nacids derived from the proteins of the ingested food on \\nthe chemical processes in the cell. Thyroid hormone, \\nmale sex hormone, growth hormone, sympathetic stim-\\nulation, and fever all increase the metabolic rate. Sleep, \\nmalnutrition, and age all decrease the metabolic rate.'),\n",

The average normal body temperature is gen -\\nerally thought to be between 98.0 °F and 98.6 °F when \\nmeasured orally and about 1°F higher rectally.\\nBody Temperature Is Controlled by the Balance Between \\nHeat Production and Heat Loss . Heat production is a \\nbyproduct of metabolism. Extra heat can be generated \\nby muscle contraction (shivering) in the short term or \\nby an increase in thyroxine in the long term. Most of the \\nheat produced in the body is generated in deep tissues. \\nThe rate of heat loss is determined by the rate of heat \\nconduction to the skin and the rate of heat conduction \\nfrom the skin to the surroundings.\\nBlood Flow to the Skin From the Body Core Provides \\nHeat Transfer. Blood vessels are distributed profusely \\nimmediately underneath the skin. An increase in \\nblood flow to these vessels causes more heat loss, and \\na decrease in blood flow to these vessels causes less heat \\nloss. The rate of flow to these vessels can vary from 0 \\nto 30 percent of the cardiac output. The skin is a highly \\neffective “heat radiator” system for transferring heat \\nfrom the body core to the skin.\\nHeat Loss (p. 911)\\nHeat loss from the skin to the surroundings occurs by \\nradiation, conduction, convection, and evaporation.\\nRadiation Causes Loss of Heat in the Form of Infrared \\nRays. All objects above absolute zero radiate infrared \\nwaves in all directions. If body temperature is greater \\nthan that of its surroundings, the body radiates heat to \\nthe surroundings. Conversely, if body temperature is \\nlower than that of its surroundings, the surroundings \\nradiate heat to the body. About 60 percent of body heat \\nis normally lost through radiation.\\nConductive Heat Loss Occurs by Direct Contact With \\nan Object. The body usually loses about 3 percent of its \\nheat by conduction to objects. An additional 15 percent \\nof body heat is lost by conduction to air; the air in \\ncontact with the surface of the skin warms to near body \\nCHAPTER 74\\nBody Temperature Regulation and Fever'),\n",

This warm air has a tendency to rise away \\nfrom the skin.\\nConvective Heat Loss Results From Air Movement. The \\nair next to the skin surface is warmed by conduction. \\nWhen this warm air is removed, the skin conducts heat \\nto the “new” layer of unwarmed air.\\nConvective heat loss is the mechanism for the cool -\\ning effect of wind. The mechanism of the cooling effect \\nof water is similar. Because water has such a high spe-\\ncific heat, however, the skin cannot warm a thin layer of \\nwater next to the body. As a consequence, heat is con-\\ntinuously removed from the body if the water is below \\nbody temperature.\\nEvaporation Is a Necessary Mechanism of Heat Loss \\nat Very High Temperatures . As water evaporates, 0.58 \\ncalorie of heat is lost for each gram of water converted \\nto the gaseous state. The energy to change water from \\na liquid to a gas is derived from the body temperature.\\nEvaporation usually accounts for 22 percent of the \\nheat lost by the body; evaporation of water through the \\nskin (insensible water loss) accounts for about 16 to 19 \\ncalories of heat loss per hour.\\nEvaporative heat loss is important when the environ-\\nmental temperatures are at or near body temperature. \\nUnder these conditions, heat loss by radiation dimin-\\nishes greatly. Evaporative heat loss becomes the only \\nway to cool the body when environmental temperatures \\nare high.\\nAir movement across the skin increases the rate of \\nevaporation and as a result increases the effectiveness \\nof evaporative heat loss (e.g., the cooling effect of a fan).\\nSweating and Its Regulation by the Autonomic \\nNervous System (p. 914)\\nSweat glands contain a deep, coiled glandular portion \\nand a straight ductal portion that exits on the surface of \\nthe skin. A primary secretion similar to plasma but with-\\nout plasma proteins is formed by the glandular portion \\nof the sweat gland. As the solution moves up the duct \\ntoward the surface of the skin, most of the electrolytes \\nare reabsorbed, leaving a dilute, watery secretion.\\nSweat glands are innervated by sympathetic cholinergic \\nfibers. When sweat glands are stimulated, the rate of pre-\\ncursor solution secretion is increased. The reabsorption \\nof electrolytes occurs at a constant rate. If large volumes \\nof precursor solution are secreted and at the same time \\nelectrolyte reabsorption remains constant, more electro-\\nlytes (primarily sodium chloride) are lost in the sweat.'),\n",

Prolonged exposure to a hot climate \\nincreases the maximum rate of sweat production from \\nabout 1 L/h in a person who is not acclimatized to as \\nmuch as 2 to 3 L/h in an acclimatized individual. This \\nlarger amount of sweat increases the rate of evaporative \\nheat loss and helps maintain normal body temperature. \\nAssociated with an increase in the rate of sweat \\nproduction is a decrease in the sodium chloride content \\nof the sweat, which allows better conservation of body \\nsalt. The decline in the sodium chloride content of the \\nsweat is primarily the result of increased secretion of \\naldosterone, which enhances sodium reabsorption from \\nthe ductal portion of the sweat gland.\\nREGULATION OF BODY TEMPERATURE—ROLE OF \\nTHE HYPOTHALAMUS (p. 915)\\nThe anterior hypothalamic-preoptic area contains large \\nnumbers of heat-sensitive neurons, whereas the septum \\nand reticular substance of the midbrain contain large \\nnumbers of cold-sensitive neurons. When the tem-\\nperature centers detect that the body is either too hot \\nor too cold, these areas institute appropriate and famil -\\niar temperature-increasing or temperature-decreasing \\nmechanisms.\\nTemperature-Decreasing Mechanisms. Three important  \\nmechanisms are used to cool the body:\\n •  Vasodilatation of the blood vessels of the skin can in-\\ncrease the amount of heat transfer to the skin by as \\nmuch as eightfold.\\n •  Sweating increases the rate of evaporative heat loss. \\nA 1°C increase in body temperature above the nor -\\nmal level of 37°C (98.6°F) induces sufficient sweating \\nto remove 10 times the basal rate of heat production.\\n •  Strong inhibition of mechanisms that increase heat \\nproduction takes place, such as shivering and chemi-\\ncal thermogenesis.\\nTemperature-Increasing Mechanisms. When the body \\nis too cold, the temperature control systems initiate \\nmechanisms to reduce heat loss and increase heat \\nproduction:\\n •  Vasoconstriction of the blood vessels of the skin de-\\ncreases transfer of heat from the core of the body.\\n •  Piloerection raises the hair to trap air next to the skin \\nand create a layer of warm air that acts as an insula-\\ntor. This mechanism works best in animals that have \\na complete layer of fur. The vestiges of this system are \\npresent in humans in the form of goosebumps, but '),\n",

Shivering can in-\\ncrease the rate of heat production by four- to fivefold. \\nThe primary motor center for shivering is located in the \\ndorsomedial portion of the posterior hypothalamus; \\nthis area is inhibited by increased body temperature \\nand stimulated by decreased body temperature. The \\noutput signals from this area are not rhythmic and \\ndo not cause the actual muscle shaking; instead, they \\ncause a generalized increase in muscle tone. The great-\\ner muscle tone sets up an oscillation in the muscle \\nspindle reflex, which leads to muscle shaking. During \\nmaximum shivering, body heat production can rise to \\nfour to five times normal.\\nSet Point for Temperature Control. The body maintains \\na critical core temperature of about 37.1 °C. When body \\ntemperature increases above this level, heat-losing \\nmechanisms are initiated. When body temperature \\nfalls below this level, heat-generating mechanisms are \\ninitiated. This critical temperature is called the set point \\nof the temperature control system. All temperature \\ncontrol mechanisms continually attempt to bring the \\nbody temperature back to this level.\\nBehavioral Control of Body Temperature (p. 919)\\nThe body has another temperature-control mechanism, \\nbehavioral control of temperature, which can be explained \\nas follows. Whenever the internal body temperature \\nbecomes too high, the temperature-controlling areas in \\nthe brain give the person a psychic sensation of being over-\\nheated. Conversely, whenever the body becomes too cold, \\nsignals from the skin and from some deep body receptors \\nelicit the feeling of cold discomfort. Therefore, the per-\\nson makes appropriate environmental adjustments to re-\\nestablish comfort, such as moving into a heated room or \\nwearing well-insulated clothing in freezing weather. This \\nis a powerful system of body temperature control and is \\nthe only really effective mechanism to maintain body heat \\ncontrol in severely cold environments.\\nABNORMALITIES OF BODY TEMPERATURE \\nREGULATION (p. 919)\\nFever Is a Body Temperature Above Normal.

Fever results from a resetting of the \\nset point for temperature control; this resetting can be \\nthe result of proteins, protein breakdown products, or \\nbacterial toxins (lipopolysaccharides), collectively called \\npyrogens. Some pyrogens act directly on the temperature \\ncontrol center, but most act indirectly.\\nWhen bacterial or viral particles are present in \\nthe body, they are phagocytized by leukocytes, tissue \\nmacrophages, and large granular killer lymphocytes.  \\nIn response to the phagocytized particles, these cells \\nrelease cytokines, a diverse group of peptide signaling \\nmolecules involved in the innate and adaptive immune \\nresponses. One of the most important of these cyto-\\nkines in causing fever is interleukin-1. Interleukin-1 \\ninduces the formation of prostaglandin E2, which acts \\non the hypothalamus to elicit the fever reaction. When \\nprostaglandin formation is blocked by drugs, the fever \\nis completely abrogated or at least reduced. This is the \\nproposed mechanism of action for aspirin and other \\nantipyretics to reduce the level of fever, and it explains \\nwhy these compounds do not lower the body tempera-\\nture in a normal, healthy person (who does not have \\nelevated levels of interleukin-1).\\nWhen the interleukin-1 mechanism resets the set \\npoint for temperature control, body temperature is \\nmaintained at a higher level. Raising the set point of \\nbody temperature induces the subjective sensations of \\nbeing cold, and nervous mechanisms initiate shiver-\\ning and piloerection. Once the body temperature has \\nreached the new set point, the individual no longer has \\nthe subjective sensation of being cold, and body tem-\\nperature is elevated above normal. When the pyrogens \\nhave been cleared from the body, the set point for tem-\\nperature control returns to normal levels. At this point, \\nthe body temperature is too warm, which induces the \\nsubjective sensations of being too hot, and nervous \\nmechanisms initiate vasodilatation of the skin blood \\nvessels and sweating. This sudden change of events in a \\nfebrile state is known as the “crisis” or, more appropri-\\nately, the “flush” and typically signals that the tempera -\\nture will soon be decreasing.'),\n",

Included in this group are \\npeptides ranging from as small as three amino ac -\\nids (e.g., thyrotropin-releasing hormone) to proteins \\nalmost 200 amino acids long (e.g., growth hormone \\nand prolactin).\\n •  Steroids. Steroids are derivatives of cholesterol and \\ninclude the adrenocortical (cortisol, aldosterone) \\nand gonadal (testosterone, estrogen, progesterone) \\nhormones.\\n •  Derivatives of the amino acid tyrosine.  Included in \\nthis group are hormones from the thyroid gland \\n(thyroxine, triiodothyronine) and adrenal medulla \\n(epinephrine and norepinephrine).\\nSynthesis, Storage, and Secretion of  \\nHormones (p. 926)\\nProtein/Peptide Hormones Are Synthesized Like Most \\nProteins. Protein/peptide hormones are synthesized on the \\nrough endoplasmic reticulum in the same fashion as most \\nother proteins. Typically, the initial protein formed by the \\nendoplasmic reticulum is larger than the active hormone \\nand is called a preprohormone. The signal sequence of this \\nlarge protein is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticulum to \\nform a prohormone. Subsequently, in the Golgi apparatus \\nthe prohormone is packaged in secretion granules along \\nwith proteolytic enzymes that cleave the prohormone \\ninto active hormone and other fragments. When the \\nendocrine cell is stimulated, the secretion granules \\nmigrate from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane. Free \\nhormone and co-peptides are then released into the \\nextracellular fluid by exocytosis.\\nSteroid Hormones Are Synthesized From Cholesterol . \\nIn contrast to protein/peptide hormones, there is little \\nhormone storage in steroid-producing endocrine \\ncells. Typically, large stores of cholesterol esters exist \\nin cytoplasmic vacuoles and can be rapidly mobilized \\nfor synthesis of steroid hormones after stimulation of \\nthe steroid-producing cell. Once the steroid hormone \\nappears in the cytoplasm, storage does not take place, \\nand the hormone diffuses through the cell membrane \\ninto the extracellular fluid.

As with steroid hormones, there is no \\nstorage of thyroid hormones in discrete granules, and \\nonce thyroid hormones appear in the cytoplasm of \\nthe cell, they leave the cell via diffusion through the \\ncell membrane. In contrast to steroid hormones, large \\nstores of thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine exist as part of \\na large iodinated protein (thyroglobulin) that is stored in \\nthe lumens of thyroid follicles.\\nIn comparison, the other group of hormones derived \\nfrom tyrosine, the adrenal medullary hormones epi-\\nnephrine and norepinephrine, are taken up into pre -\\nformed vesicles and stored until they are secreted. As \\nwith protein hormones stored in secretion granules, \\ncatecholamines are released from adrenal medullary \\ncells through exocytosis.\\nControl of Hormonal Secretion and Negative \\nFeedback (p. 929)\\nIn most instances, the rate of hormonal secretion is con-\\ntrolled by negative feedback. In general, endocrine glands \\ntend to oversecrete hormone, which in turn drives target \\ncell function. When the hormonal actions on the target \\ncell are in excess, the resultant conditions or products \\nfeed back to the endocrine gland and cause a negative \\neffect on the gland, decreasing its secretory rate.\\nMECHANISMS OF ACTION OF HORMONES (p. 930)\\nHormone Receptors and Their Activation\\nHormones control cellular processes by interacting \\nwith receptors on target cells. These receptors are (1) \\neither on or within the cell membrane, as in the case of \\npeptide/protein and catecholamine hormones, and (2) \\nwithin the cell in either the cytoplasm or nucleus, as is \\nthe case for steroid and thyroid hormones.

Often, coupling G \\nproteins in the cell membrane link hormone receptors to \\nthe second-messenger mechanisms. Second-messenger \\nmechanisms include the following:\\n •  Adenylyl cyclase–cyclic adenosine monophosphate \\n(cAMP). Hormone-receptor interaction may stimu-\\nlate (or inhibit) the membrane-bound enzyme ad-\\nenylyl cyclase. Stimulation of this enzyme results \\nin synthesis of the second-messenger cAMP . The \\ncAMP activates protein kinase A, leading to phos -\\nphorylation that either activates or inactivates target \\nenzymes.\\n •  Plasma membrane phospholipids. Hormone-receptor \\ninteraction activates the membrane-bound enzyme \\nphospholipase C, which in turn causes phospholip-\\nids in the cell membrane (especially those derived \\nfrom phosphatidylinositol) to split into the second \\nmessengers diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate.  \\nInositol triphosphate mobilizes calcium from in -\\nternal stores, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, \\nand the calcium in turn activates protein kinase C. \\nPhosphorylation of enzymes by protein kinase C \\nactivates and deactivates enzymes mediating the \\nhormone responses. In addition, the activity of \\nprotein kinase C is further enhanced by the second \\nmessenger diacylglycerol. Finally, diacylglycerol is \\nhydrolyzed to arachidonic acid, the precursor for \\nprostaglandins, which also influence hormonal re -\\nsponses.\\n •  Calcium-calmodulin. Hormone-receptor interac -\\ntion activates calcium channels in the plasma mem-\\nbrane, permitting calcium to enter cells. Calcium \\nmay also be mobilized from intercellular stores such \\nas the endoplasmic reticulum. The calcium ions bind \\nwith the protein calmodulin; this complex alters the \\nactivity of calcium-dependent enzymes and thus in -\\ntercellular reactions.\\nProtein/peptide hormones may exert actions inde-\\npendent of G-protein–linked second messenger events, \\nand other second-messenger mechanisms may trans-\\nduce hormonal responses. For example, the second mes -\\nsenger cyclic guanosine monophosphate  mediates the \\neffects of atrial natriuretic peptide.

In contrast \\nto protein/peptide hormones and catecholamines, \\nsteroid and thyroid hormones enter the cell and bind to \\nintracellular receptors located in the cytoplasm or nucleus \\nof the cell. The hormone-receptor interaction results in \\na conformational change in the receptor. This permits \\nbinding of the hormone-receptor complex to specific \\npoints on DNA strands in the chromosomes, which \\nresults in activation of specific genes, transcription, and \\ntranslation of proteins that are essential for mediating \\nthe hormonal response. Because the transcription \\nmechanism is involved in mediating the hormonal \\nresponse, hours may be required for the biologic effects \\nto become evident.\\nMEASUREMENT OF HORMONE \\nCONCENTRATIONS IN THE BLOOD (p. 936)\\nMost hormones are present in the blood in minute con-\\ncentrations (often in nanograms per liter or even pico -\\ngrams per liter). These low concentrations of hormones \\ncan be measured by the following methods.\\nRadioimmunoassay. The principle of the radioimmu -\\nnoassay is based on the combined incubation of the \\nfollowing substances:\\n •  A fi xed amount of antibody specific for the hormone\\n •  A fi xed amount of radioactive-labeled hormone\\n •  The plasma sample\\nBecause the amount of antibody present is limiting, \\nthe radioactive and unlabeled native hormones compete \\nfor the binding sites on the antibody. High concentrations \\nof native hormone displace more of the labeled hormone \\nfrom the antibody. At the end of the incubation period, \\nbound and free hormones are separated and the amount \\nof radioactivity is determined. The greater the amount \\nof native hormone in the plasma sample, the lower is \\nthe amount of radioactivity in the bound fraction. The \\namount of native hormone in the sample is calculated by \\ncomparison with a standard curve generated by incuba-\\ntion of different amounts of unlabeled hormone (rather \\nthan the plasma sample), with antibody and radioactively \\nlabeled hormone as described.\\nOther competitive binding procedures can be used \\nto measure hormone levels in the plasma.

Although the axons from \\nthe magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic and para -\\nventricular nuclei terminate in the posterior pituitary \\ngland, the nerve fibers from the hypothalamic cell bod-\\nies that synthesize the hypophysiotropic hormones lead \\nto the median eminence. Here, the releasing and inhib-\\niting hormones are stored in secretion granules in the \\nnerve terminals. On stimulation of these hypothalamic \\nneuroendocrine cells, their neurohormones are released \\ninto the capillary plexus of the median eminence, flow \\nthrough the hypothalamic-hypophysial portal vessels, \\nand reach the sinusoids around the adenohypophysial \\ncells. The anterior pituitary cells respond to the hypophy-\\nsiotropic hormones by either increasing or decreasing the \\nsynthesis and secretion of adenohypophysial hormones.\\nThe six established hypophysiotropic hormones \\nare listed in Table 76–2.

Because GH also stimulates osteoblasts, which \\ndeposit new bone, bones thicken and total bone mass \\nis increased by GH even after epiphyseal closure.\\n •  Promotion of protein deposition in tissues.  GH is a \\nprotein anabolic hormone and produces a positive \\nnitrogen balance. It increases amino acid uptake in \\nmost cells and the synthesis of amino acids into pro-\\nteins.\\n •  Promotion of fat utilization for energy.  GH causes \\nthe mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tis -\\nsue and the preferential utilization of free fatty \\nacids for energy. This action of GH, together with \\nits protein anabolic effects, produces an increase \\nin lean body mass. The lipolytic effects of GH re-\\nquire several hours to occur. At least part of this \\neffect is due to the actions of GH to impair glucose \\nuptake into adipose cells. Because GH increases \\nplasma levels of free fatty acids and keto acids, it is \\nketogenic.\\n •  Impairment of carbohydrate utilization for energy.  \\nGH decreases the uptake and utilization of glucose \\nby many insulin-sensitive cells, such as muscle and \\nadipose tissue. As a result, blood glucose concentra-\\ntion tends to rise and insulin secretion increases to \\ncompensate for the GH-induced insulin resistance; \\nthus, GH is diabetogenic.\\nSomatomedins and Anabolic Effects of Growth \\nHormone (p. 943)\\nThe effects of GH on linear growth and protein metabo -\\nlism are not direct, but they are indirectly mediated via \\nthe generation of polypeptides called somatomedins or \\ninsulin-like growth factors (IGFs). Somatomedins are \\nsecreted by the liver and other tissues. Somatomedin C, \\nor IGF-1, is a circulating 70–amino-acid peptide pro -\\nduced by the liver that reflects plasma GH levels.

This decrease in adult life may be \\npartially responsible for the decline in lean body mass \\nand increase in adipose mass that are characteristic of \\nsenescence. Three general categories of stimuli increase \\nGH secretion:\\n •  Fasting, chronic protein deprivation, or other condi-\\ntions in which there is an acute fall in plasma levels \\nof metabolic substrates such as glucose and free fatty \\nacids\\n •  Increased plasma levels of amino acids, such as occur \\nafter a protein meal\\n •  Exercise and stressful stimuli, such as pain and fever\\nClearly, the increase in GH during fasting would be \\nbeneficial because GH enhances lipolysis and decreases \\nperipheral utilization of glucose. After a protein meal, \\nincreased plasma levels of GH would favor the utiliza-\\ntion of amino acids for protein synthesis.\\nAbnormalities of Growth Hormone Secretion and \\nTheir Impact on the Skeletal System (p. 947)\\nThe importance of GH in linear growth is reflected by \\nthe clinical states associated with a deficiency or excess \\nsecretion of GH before epiphyseal closure. Short stat-\\nure (dwarfism) occurs when pituitary secretion of GH is \\ndeficient. In comparison, children grow tall (gigantism) \\nwhen tumors of the somatotropes of the anterior pitu -\\nitary secrete large amounts of GH. If a pituitary tumor \\nsecreting GH appears after epiphyseal closure, the adult \\nform of the disease occurs. With acromegaly, linear \\ngrowth is normal, but there is enlargement of the hands \\nand feet, protrusion of the lower jaw (prognathism), \\nand overgrowth of facial bones. In addition, virtually all \\ninternal organs are of increased size. The anti-insulin \\neffects of GH may ultimately lead to diabetes mellitus in \\nstates of chronic GH excess.\\nTHE POSTERIOR PITUITARY GLAND AND ITS \\nRELATION TO THE HYPOTHALAMUS (p. 948)\\nThe neurohypophysial hormones ADH and oxytocin \\nare synthesized as preprohormones in the cell bodies '),\n",

ADH is synthesized \\nlargely in the supraoptic nucleus, and oxytocin is syn-\\nthesized largely in the paraventricular nucleus, although \\neach hormone is synthesized in the alternate site. The \\nsecretion granules containing either ADH or oxytocin \\nalso contain an additional protein, or neurophysin, that \\nis part of the preprohormone. When a nerve impulse \\ntravels from the cell body of the magnocellular neu-\\nrons down the axon to the nerve terminal, both the \\nneurohormone and the corresponding neurophysin \\nare released from secretion granules into the capillary \\nblood as separate polypeptides.

ADH plays an \\nimportant role in the regulation of plasma osmolality. \\nAs discussed in Chapters 28 and 29, in the absence \\nof ADH the collecting tubules and collecting ducts \\nare largely impermeable to water, which prevents \\nsignificant reabsorption of water in this portion of the \\nnephron, thus resulting in a large volume of dilute urine \\nand a net loss of water. Consequently, the osmolality of \\nbody fluids rises. In comparison, when increased ADH \\nactivates V2  receptors on the basolateral side of the \\ntubules via a cyclic adenosine monophosphate  second \\nmessenger system, cytoplasmic vesicles containing \\nwater channels (aquaporins) are inserted in the apical \\nmembrane. This increases the permeability of the \\ntubules to water; therefore, water moves by osmosis \\nfrom the tubular to the peritubular capillary fluid. In \\nthe collecting ducts, the urine becomes concentrated, \\nand its volume decreases. As a result, there is retention \\nof water in excess of solute, and the osmolality of body \\nfluids decreases.\\nIn accordance with its role in the regulation of the \\nosmotic pressure of plasma, ADH secretion is sensi -\\ntive to small changes in plasma osmolality (approxi -\\nmately 1 percent).

Circu -\\nlating ADH increases the permeability of the collect -\\ning ducts to water, which ultimately decreases plasma \\nosmolality to normal levels. The opposite changes in \\nneuronal discharge and ADH secretion occur when \\nplasma osmolality declines. ADH secretion is regu -\\nlated by osmoreceptors in the anterior hypothalamus \\nthat send nervous signals to the supraoptic and para -\\nventricular nuclei. Osmoreceptors are outside the \\nblood-brain barrier and appear to be located in the \\ncircumventricular organs, primarily the organum vas-\\nculosum of the lateral terminalis. These same osmo -\\nreceptors may also mediate the thirst response to \\nincreased plasma osmolality.\\nADH Secretion Is Influenced by Multiple Factors. Other \\nthan increased plasma osmolality, stimuli that increase \\nADH secretion include hypovolemia, hypotension, \\nnausea, pain, stress, and a number of drugs, including \\nmorphine, nicotine, and barbiturates. Factors that \\ndecrease ADH secretion include hypervolemia, hyper -\\ntension, and alcohol. The influence of these factors on \\nthe neurons in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei \\nthat secrete ADH may have an impact on the regulation \\nof body fluid osmolality. For example, in hypovolemic \\nstates, elevated plasma levels of ADH may decrease \\nplasma osmolality.\\nADH Contributes to the Maintenance of Blood Pressure \\nDuring Hypovolemia. Stimulation of ADH secretion \\nby hypovolemia and/or hypotension is achieved by \\nreflexes initiated from receptors in both the high- and \\nlow-pressure regions of the circulation. The high-\\npressure receptors are those in the carotid sinus and \\naortic arch; the low-pressure receptors are those in \\nthe cardiopulmonary circulation, especially in the \\natria. At least a 5 percent decrease in blood volume \\nis necessary to increase ADH secretion appreciably \\nby this reflex mechanism. Greater degrees of hypo -\\nvolemia and hypotension can result in very large \\nincreases in plasma ADH concentration to levels \\nmuch higher than those required to achieve maximal \\nantidiuresis. When these unusually high plasma \\nlevels of ADH occur, such as during hypotensive \\nhemorrhage, ADH constricts vascular smooth muscle \\nand helps restore blood pressure to normal levels. \\nThis action of ADH is a result of the peptide binding \\nto vascular V1 receptors on arteriolar smooth muscle. \\nThe vasoconstriction induced by ADH is mediated \\nby calcium- and phospholipase C–generated second \\nmessengers.'),\n",

Each follicle is surrounded by a single layer of cells \\nand filled with a proteinaceous material called colloid. \\nThe primary constituent of colloid is the large glyco-\\nprotein thyroglobulin, which contains the thyroid hor -\\nmones in its molecule. The following steps are required \\nfor the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones into \\nthe blood (Figures 77–1 and 77–2):\\n •  Iodide trapping (iodide pump) or sodium-iodide sym-\\nporter (NIS). Iodine is essential to thyroid hormone \\nsynthesis. Ingested iodine is converted to iodide \\nand absorbed from the gut. Most circulating iodide \\nis excreted by the kidneys; much of the remainder \\nis taken up and concentrated by the thyroid gland. \\nTo achieve this, the thyroid follicular cells actively \\ntransport iodide from the circulation across their \\nbasal membrane into the cell by the NIS. In a nor-\\nmal thyroid gland, the NIS concentrates the iodide \\nmany times over the concentration in the blood. \\nSeveral anions, such as thiocyanate and perchlorate, \\ndecrease iodide transport by competitive inhibition. \\nIn so doing, they decrease the synthesis of thyroid \\nhormones and are used to treat hyperthyroidism.\\n •  Oxidation of iodide. Once in the thyroid gland, \\niodide is rapidly oxidized to iodine by thyroid per -\\noxidase; this occurs at the apical membrane of the \\nfollicular cells.\\n •  Synthesis of thyroglobulin. Thyroglobulin is synthe-\\nsized by the follicular cells and secreted into the col-\\nloid through exocytosis of secretion granules that \\nalso contain thyroid peroxidase. Each thyroglobulin \\nmolecule contains many tyrosyl groups, but only a \\nfraction become iodinated.\\n •  Iodination (organification) and coupling. Once iodide \\nis oxidized to iodine, it is rapidly attached to the 3 \\nposition of tyrosine molecules of thyroglobulin to \\ngenerate monoiodotyrosine (MIT). MIT is next io -\\ndinated in the 5 position to give diiodotyrosine (DIT). \\nThereafter, two DIT molecules are coupled to form \\nthyroxine (T4), the major product of the coupling re-\\naction, or one MIT and one DIT molecule are coupled \\nCHAPTER 77\\nThyroid Metabolic Hormones'),\n",

A small amount of \\nreverse T 3  (RT 3 ) is formed by condensation of DIT \\nwith MIT. These reactions are catalyzed by thyroid \\nperoxidase and blocked by antithyroid drugs such as \\npropylthiouracil. Approximately two thirds of the io-\\ndinated compounds bound to thyroglobulin are MIT \\nor DIT; most of the remainder are the active hor -\\nmones T 3  and especially T 4 . Thyroglobulin is stored \\nin the lumen of the follicle as colloid until the gland \\nis stimulated to secrete thyroid hormones.\\n •  Proteolysis, deiodination, and secretion. The release \\nof T3 , T 4 , and RT 3  into the blood requires proteolysis \\nof the thyroglobulin. At the apical surface of the fol -\\nlicular cells, colloid is taken up from the lumen of the \\nfollicles through endocytosis.

In \\nthe case of the thyroid hormones, it is the free hormone \\nthat is taken up by tissues, in which it exerts biological \\neffects and is metabolized.

For example, during \\npregnancy, a fall in free thyroid hormone concentration \\ninduced by increased TBG levels in the plasma causes \\na compensatory rise in TSH secretion, which in turn \\nincreases the production of free thyroid hormones until \\nnormal plasma levels of free hormone are achieved. \\nIncreased thyroid hormone secretion continues until \\nplasma levels of free hormone are normal.

In fact, most \\nof the T 3  and RT 3  in the plasma come from circulating \\nT 4  that has been deiodinated in peripheral tissues rather \\nthan secreted from the thyroid gland.

Increased cardiac output is associ-\\nated with elevations in both stroke volume and heart \\nrate, in part because thyroid hormones have direct \\nand indirect effects on the heart to increase the heart \\nrate and force of contraction.\\n •  Increased pulse pressure but not mean arterial pres -\\nsure. Because of the increased cardiac output (stroke \\nvolume) and reduced peripheral vascular resistance, \\nsystolic arterial pressure is elevated and diastolic \\narterial pressure is reduced, which results in an in-\\ncrease in pulse pressure but usually no change in \\nmean arterial pressure.'),\n",

An in-\\ncreased metabolic rate is dependent on oxidation of \\nmetabolic substrates. Thyroid hormones increase \\nthe utilization of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins \\nfor energy. If food intake is not increased suffi-\\nciently, there is depletion of body fats and proteins, \\nand weight loss occurs. Although thyroid hormones \\npromote lipolysis of triglycerides and increments in \\nplasma levels of free fatty acids, they also decrease \\nthe circulating levels of cholesterol. This action is due \\nto increased formation of low-density lipoprotein re-\\nceptors in the liver, resulting in increased removal \\nof cholesterol from the circulation, secretion in the \\nbile, and then excretion in the feces. Because thyroid \\nhormones increase the rate of metabolic reactions, \\nthe need for vitamins is greater, and excess thyroid \\nhormone can lead to vitamin deficiency.\\nThyroid Hormones Are Essential for Normal Growth \\nand Development. Thyroid hormones are essential for \\nmany aspects of growth and development; they play \\nan important role in the development of the skeletal \\nsystem, teeth, epidermis, and central nervous system. \\nIn hypothyroid children, the rate of growth is greatly \\nreduced.

Some \\nof the metabolic effects of cortisol are permissive in that \\ncortisol does not initiate the changes, but its presence \\nat normal plasma levels permits certain metabolic \\nprocesses. Cortisol exerts the following effects on \\nmetabolism:\\n •  Cortisol decreases protein stores in extrahepatic tis -\\nsues. In muscle and other extrahepatic tissues, corti -\\nsol decreases amino acid uptake and inhibits protein \\nsynthesis; at the same time, it increases the degrada-\\ntion of proteins. As a result of these catabolic and \\nantianabolic effects of cortisol, amino acids tend to \\nincrease in the blood and are taken up by the liver, \\nwhere they are converted to glucose and proteins, \\nincluding gluconeogenic enzymes.\\n •  Cortisol tends to increase the blood glucose concen -\\ntration in two ways.  First, cortisol increases hepatic \\nproduction of glucose by increasing gluconeogenesis. \\nThe proteins mobilized from peripheral tissues are \\nconverted to glucose and glycogen in the liver. By \\nmaintaining glycogen reserves, cortisol allows other \\nglycolytic hormones, such as epinephrine and glu -\\ncagon, to mobilize glucose in times of need, such \\nas between meals. A second way in which cortisol \\ntends to increase the blood glucose concentration is \\nby impairing the utilization of glucose in peripheral \\ntissues; cortisol has an anti-insulin effect in tissues \\nsuch as muscle and adipose tissue and impairs the \\nuptake and utilization of glucose for energy. Like \\ngrowth hormone, cortisol is diabetogenic because it \\ntends to increase the blood glucose concentration.\\n •  Cortisol plays an important role in the mobilization \\nof fatty acids from adipose tissue. Although weakly \\nlipolytic itself, normal levels of cortisol exert a per-\\nmissive effect on the mobilization of fatty acids dur -\\ning fasting. During fasting, cortisol allows other li -\\npolytic hormones, such as epinephrine and growth \\nhormone, to mobilize fatty acids from lipid stores.\\nIncreased Cortisol Secretion Is Important for Resistance \\nto Stress.

During \\nexercise the insertion of glucose transporters into the \\ncell membrane is insulin independent.\\nIn the Liver, Insulin Promotes Glucose Uptake and \\nStorage and Inhibits Glucose Production . Insulin also has \\nthe following actions in the liver:\\n •  It increases the flux of glucose into cells.  Increased \\ninflux is achieved not by increasing the number of \\nglucose transporters in the cell membranes but by \\ninducing glucokinase, which increases the phos -\\nphorylation of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate.\\n •  It increases glycogen synthesis by activating glycogen \\nsynthase (as well as by increasing glucose uptake).\\n •  It directs the flow of glucose through glycolysis by in -\\ncreasing the activity of key glycolytic enzymes (e.g., \\nphosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase).\\n •  It decreases the hepatic output of glucose  in several \\nways. First, insulin impairs glycogenolysis by inhib-\\niting glycogen phosphorylase. Second, insulin de -\\ncreases the exit of glucose from the liver by inhibiting  \\nglucose-6-phosphatase. Third, insulin inhibits gluco-\\nneogenesis by decreasing the amino acid uptake into \\nthe liver (see the discussion on effects on protein \\nmetabolism) and by decreasing the activity or levels \\nof key gluconeogenic enzymes (e.g., pyruvate carbox-\\nylase and fructose-1,6-diphosphatase).\\n •  It enhances synthesis of fatty acids in two ways. First, \\ninsulin increases the flow of glucose to pyruvate (gly-\\ncolysis) and the subsequent conversion to acetyl–co-\\nenzyme A (acetyl-CoA).  Second, insulin stimulates \\nacetyl-CoA carboxylase, which converts acetyl-CoA \\nto malonyl-CoA and is the rate-limiting step in the \\nsynthesis of fatty acids.\\nIn Adipose Tissue, Insulin Facilitates Glucose Entry Into \\nCells. This facilitation is achieved in much the same \\nway that insulin promotes glucose uptake into muscle \\ncells—by increasing glucose transporters in the cell \\nmembrane. Subsequently, the metabolism of glucose \\nto α-glycerol phosphate provides the glycerol that is \\nneeded for esterification of fatty acids for storage as \\ntriglycerides (see the discussion of the effects on fat \\nmetabolism).\\nInsulin Has Little Effect on Glucose Uptake and Use by \\nthe Brain.

This enhancement is \\naccomplished in several ways:\\n •  Insulin inhibits hormone-sensitive lipase. This de-\\ncreases the rate of lipolysis of triglycerides and the \\nrelease of stored fatty acids into the circulation.\\n •  Insulin increases glucose transport.  The subsequent \\nmetabolism of glucose to α-glycerol phosphate in -\\ncreases the rate of esterification of fatty acids for stor -\\nage as triglycerides.\\n •  Insulin induces lipoprotein lipase. This enzyme is \\npresent in the capillary wall and splits circulating \\ntriglycerides into fatty acids, which is necessary for \\ntheir transport into fat cells.\\nIn the Liver, Insulin Promotes the Synthesis and Inhibits \\nthe Oxidation of Fatty Acids. As discussed previously, \\ninsulin promotes the synthesis of fatty acids from \\nglucose in the liver. Because of the increased availability \\nof α-glycerol phosphate from glycolysis, fatty acids \\nare esterified to form triglycerides. Oxidation of \\nfatty acids is impaired because of the increased \\nconversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA by acetyl-\\nCoA carboxylase, as discussed. Malonyl-CoA inhibits \\ncarnitine acyltransferase, which is responsible for \\nshuttling fatty acids from the cytoplasm into the \\nmitochondria for β oxidation and conversion to keto \\nacids; insulin is antiketogenic.\\nEffects of Insulin on Protein Metabolism (p. 988)\\nInsulin is an anabolic hormone. It increases the uptake \\nof several amino acids from the blood into cells by stim-\\nulating transport across the cell membrane, which lim -\\nits the rise in plasma levels of certain amino acids after a \\nprotein meal. In addition, insulin increases protein syn-\\nthesis by stimulating both gene transcription and trans -\\nlation of mRNA. Finally, insulin inhibits catabolism of \\nproteins and therefore decreases the release of amino \\nacids from muscle.\\nInsulin, like growth hormone, is essential to growth. \\nDiabetic animals fail to grow.

Although several factors can increase or \\ndecrease insulin secretion, the major control of insulin \\nsecretion is exerted by a feedback effect of blood \\nglucose on the beta cells of the pancreas. When blood \\nglucose concentration rises above fasting levels, insulin \\nsecretion increases. As a result of the subsequent effects \\nof insulin to stimulate glucose uptake by the liver and \\nperipheral tissues, the blood glucose concentration \\nreturns to normal levels, providing an important \\nnegative feedback mechanism for controlling the blood \\nglucose concentration.\\nMultiple Stimuli Other Than Hyperglycemia Increase \\nInsulin Secretion. The following stimuli increase insulin \\nsecretion:\\n •  Amino acids, especially arginine, lysine, leucine, and \\nalanine. As a result, dietary amino acids are removed \\nfrom the blood and used by cells to synthesize pro-\\nteins. Amino acids have a synergistic effect with glu-\\ncose in stimulating insulin secretion.\\n •  Gastrointestinal hormones, especially gastric in-\\nhibitory polypeptide and glucagon-like polypeptide \\n1.

Testosterone is also required \\nin adult men for maintenance and normal function of \\nthe primary sex organs. Testosterone has effects on \\nbone, stimulating growth and proliferation of bone \\ncells, resulting in increased density of the bones. It also \\nhas effects on hair distribution and causes the skin to \\nthicken. Testosterone affects the liver, causing synthesis \\nof clotting factors and hepatic lipases. Under the \\ninfluence of testosterone, blood high-density lipoprotein \\nlevels decrease and low-density lipoprotein levels \\nincrease.

About 2 days before ovulation, a surge of LH secre-\\ntion, 6- to 10-fold above normal, occurs.

At \\nthe beginning of each cycle, most of the endometrium \\nhas been lost during menstruation, and only a thin \\nlayer of basal endometrial stroma remains. The only \\nremaining epithelial cells are located in the crypts of the \\nendometrium and in the deep portions of the endometrial \\nglands. Estrogen secreted from developing follicles during \\nthe early portion of the cycle stimulates rapid proliferation \\nof stromal and epithelial cells.

Progesterone acts synergistically with \\nestrogen, but it has only a weak inhibitory effect by itself.\\nAs the level of estrogen rises, the rate of secretion \\nof the pituitary hormones begins to fall; however, for \\nunknown reasons, the pituitary gland secretes a large \\namount of LH immediately before ovulation, when \\nestrogen levels are elevated. This surge of LH at a time \\nwhen LH secretion “should” be suppressed by the inhib-\\nitory influence of estrogen triggers ovulation and trans-\\nformation of the granulosa and thecal cells to luteal cells.\\nAfter ovulation, the estrogen and progesterone \\nsecreted from the corpus luteum again exert an inhibi -\\ntory effect on the secretion of LH and FSH.\\nInhibin also is secreted from the corpus luteum.

Dilation of the arteries leading into the tissue is \\nmediated by parasympathetic nerves that release nitric \\noxide from their nerve endings on the vascular smooth \\nmuscle of the arteries. Parasympathetic stimulation also \\ncauses secretion of mucus from Bartholin’s gland, which \\nis located underneath the labia minora.\\nWith appropriate local sensory and psychic stim -\\nulation, reflexes are initiated that cause the female \\norgasm.\\nFEMALE FERTILITY (p. 1052)\\nFemale fertility depends on properly timed ovulation, \\nability of sperm to reach the ovum in the fallopian \\ntube within 24 hours of ovulation, and the ability of the \\nzygote to implant and survive in the endometrium.

With this division, the oocyte is transformed \\ninto a secondary oocyte containing 23 unpaired chromo-\\nsomes. A few hours after a sperm cell enters the oocyte, \\nthe nucleus divides again and a second polar body is \\nexpelled, forming the mature ovum, which still contains \\n23 unpaired chromosomes.\\nThe Ovum Enters the Fallopian Tube (Oviduct) . At \\novulation, the ovum and surrounding layers of \\ngranulosa cells, referred to as the corona radiata, are \\nexpelled from the ovary into the peritoneal cavity at the \\nostium, or opening, of the fallopian tube (Figure 83–1). \\nThe ciliated epithelium lining the tubes creates a weak \\ncurrent that draws the ovum into the tube.\\nFertilization Takes Place in the Fallopian Tube . Within \\n5 to 10 minutes of ejaculation, sperm cells reach the \\nampullae at the ovarian ends of the fallopian tubes \\naided by contractions of the uterus and fallopian tubes. \\nNormally, approximately several hundred million sperm \\nare deposited at the cervix during coitus, but only a \\nfew thousand reach the ampullae of the fallopian tubes \\nwhere fertilization usually takes place.\\nBefore fertilization can occur, the corona radiata \\nmust be removed through the successive actions of \\nmany sperm cells that release the proteolytic enzymes \\nin the acrosome at the head of the sperm cell. Once the \\nway is cleared, one sperm cell can bind to and penetrate \\nthe zona pellucida surrounding the ovum and enter the \\novum.

Blood capillaries grow into the cords \\nfrom the vascular system of the embryo, and about  \\n21 days after fertilization, blood flow begins into the \\ncapillaries. Simultaneously, on the maternal side, \\nsinuses develop that are perfused with blood from the \\nuterine vessels, surrounding the trophoblast cords. \\nThe cords branch extensively as they continue to grow, \\nforming the placental villi into which embryonic cap-\\nillaries grow. The villi contain capillaries carrying fetal \\nblood, and they are surrounded by sinuses filled with \\nmaternal blood. The two blood supplies remain sepa-\\nrated by several cell layers, and no mixing of the blood \\nfrom the mother and fetus occurs.\\nBlood enters the fetal side of the placenta from two \\numbilical arteries and returns to the fetus by way of a \\nsingle umbilical vein. The paired uterine arteries of the \\nmother give rise to branches that supply blood for the \\nmaternal sinuses, which are drained by branches of  \\nthe uterine veins.\\nPlacental Permeability and Transport (p. 1057)\\nOxygen Diffuses From the Maternal Blood Through the \\nPlacental Membranes and Into the Fetal Blood . The \\nmean partial pressure of oxygen (P o 2 ) for the blood \\nin the maternal sinuses is about 50 mm Hg, whereas \\nin the venous end of the fetal capillaries, it averages  \\n30 mm Hg. The 20 mm Hg pressure gradient is the driving \\nforce for the diffusion of oxygen from the maternal to the \\nfetal blood.\\nSeveral factors assist in the diffusion of oxygen from \\nthe mother to the fetus:\\n •  The f etal hemoglobin has a greater affinity for oxy -\\ngen than does adult hemoglobin. At the P o 2  pres -\\nent in the placenta, fetal hemoglobin can carry 20 to  \\n50 percent more oxygen than maternal hemoglobin.\\n •  The c oncentration of hemoglobin in the fetal blood \\nis 50 percent greater than that in the maternal blood.\\n •  The Bohr effect operates in favor of transfer of ox -\\nygen from the maternal blood to that of the fetus. \\nThe Bohr effect refers to the effect of an increase '),\n",

Fetal \\nblood entering the placenta has a high P co2, but it \\nrapidly diffuses into the maternal blood because of a \\nfavorable pressure gradient. As a result, the Pco2 in \\nthe fetal blood decreases while that of the maternal \\nblood increases, causing the affinity of the fetal he-\\nmoglobin for oxygen to increase and the affinity of \\nthe maternal hemoglobin to decrease.\\nCarbon Dioxide Diffuses Readily Through the Membranes \\nof the Placenta. Even though the pressure gradient \\ndriving the diffusion averages only about 2 to 3 mm \\nHg, the CO2 molecule is extremely soluble in biologic \\nmembranes and can move easily across the layers of the \\nplacenta.\\nMovement of Metabolic Substrates Such as Glucose \\nand Fatty Acids Across the Placenta Occurs by the Same \\nMechanisms That Operate in Other Parts of the Body . \\nGlucose diffusion is aided by a facilitated diffusion \\nprocess, and fatty acids cross the membranes by simple \\ndiffusion. Electrolytes such as sodium and potassium \\nmove by both diffusion and active transport.\\nRemoval of Waste Products From Fetal Blood to Maternal \\nBlood. Metabolic waste products formed in the fetus \\nalso diffuse through the placental membrane into the \\nmaternal blood and are then excreted along with the \\nexcretory products of the mother. These waste products \\ninclude especially the nonprotein nitrogens such as urea, \\nuric acid, and creatinine.\\nHORMONAL FACTORS IN PREGNANCY (p. 1059)\\nIn pregnancy, the placenta forms especially large \\nquantities of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), \\nestrogens, progesterone,  and human chorionic somato -\\nmammotropin. The first three of these hormones—and \\nprobably the fourth as well—are essential to a normal \\npregnancy.\\nHuman Chorionic Gonadotropin Causes \\nPersistence of the Corpus Luteum and Prevents \\nMenstruation\\nThe glycoprotein hormone hCG is produced by tro -\\nphoblast cells beginning 8 to 9 days after fertilization. \\nIt reaches the maternal blood and binds to luteiniz -\\ning hormone (LH) receptors in the cells of the corpus \\nluteum.

The hCG \\neffect on the corpus luteum is the same as that of LH: \\nthe hCG maintains the function of the corpus luteum \\nand continues to stimulate its secretion of large amounts \\nof progesterone and estrogen, so the endometrium can \\ncontinue in a viable state that can support early devel -\\nopment of the embryo. As a result of the hCG secretion, \\nmenstruation does not occur.\\nIn addition, hCG binds to LH receptors in the Leydig \\ncells of the testes of male embryos; this action stimu -\\nlates testosterone secretion, which is essential to differ -\\nentiation of the male sex organs.\\nEstrogen and Progesterone (p. 1060)\\nThe syncytial trophoblast cells of the placenta secrete \\nestrogens and progesterone. Late in pregnancy, the \\nestrogen secretory rate is approximately 30 times the \\nnormal rate. The high concentrations of estrogens cause \\nthe following effects:\\n •  Enlar gement of the mother’s uterus\\n •  Enlar gement of the mother’s breasts, with growth of \\nthe ductile structure\\n •  Enlar gement of the mother’s external genitalia\\nProgesterone is also necessary for pregnancy. The \\nrate of secretion reaches 10 times the maximum level \\npresent during nonpregnant cycles. Progesterone has \\nthe following functions:\\n •  Pr omotion of storage of nutrients in the endometrial \\ncells, transforming them into decidual cells\\n •  Re duction of contractility of the uterine smooth \\nmuscle, preventing contractions\\n •  Pr omotion of secretion of nutrient-rich fluids from \\nthe epithelium of the fallopian tubes that sustain the \\nzygote before implantation\\n •  Pr omotion of development of the alveoli of the \\nbreasts\\nHuman Chorionic Somatomammotropin (p. 1061)\\nHuman chorionic somatomammotropin is a third pla -\\ncental hormone. This hormone is secreted by the pla -\\ncenta starting during the fifth week of pregnancy. The \\nspecific function of the hormone remains unknown, \\nalthough it does have metabolic effects similar to those \\nof growth hormone. It reduces insulin sensitivity of \\ntissues and decreases glucose utilization. Human cho-\\nrionic somatomammotropin also promotes releases of \\nfatty acids from fat stores.'),\n",

Changes in hormonal \\nlevels and mechanical properties of the uterus and its \\ncontents contribute to the increase in uterine contractility.\\nHormones Increase Uterine Contractility . Beginning in \\nthe seventh month of pregnancy, the rate of progesterone \\nsecretion remains constant, whereas the rate of estrogen \\nsecretion continues to rise. Although progesterone \\nreduces the contractility of uterine smooth muscle, \\nestrogen has the opposite effect. Because the estrogen-\\nto-progesterone ratio increases during the final weeks of \\npregnancy, the excitability of the organ increases.\\nOxytocin, which is secreted from the posterior pitu -\\nitary, can cause uterine contractions. During the final \\nweeks of pregnancy the oxytocin receptors on the cells \\nof the uterine smooth muscle increase, which increases \\nthe intensity of response for a given concentration of \\nhormone. At the time of labor, the oxytocin concen-\\ntration is elevated considerably above normal. There is \\nreason to believe that oxytocin contributes to the mech-\\nanism of parturition.\\nStretch of the Uterus and Cervix Increases Uterine \\nContractility. Stretch of smooth muscle increases its \\nexcitability. The size of the fetus near the end of pregnancy \\nprovides continual distention of the uterus, and the \\nvigorous movements of the maturing fetus provide \\nintermittent stretch of portions of the smooth muscle \\nwall of the organ. The cervix becomes greatly distended as \\nthe end of pregnancy approaches. Contractions initiated \\nby stretch of this part of the uterus can spread upward \\nthrough the body of the uterus. In addition, stretch and \\ndistention of the cervix elicit reflexes that cause release of \\noxytocin from the posterior pituitary gland.\\nOnset of Labor—A Positive Feedback \\nMechanism for Its Initiation (p. 1065)\\nBeginning in the sixth month of pregnancy, the uterus \\nundergoes periodic slow rhythmical contractions \\ncalled Braxton-Hicks contractions.

If the second contraction is more powerful than \\nthe first, an even greater elevation of excitability results, \\nfollowed by an even more powerful contraction.\\nSuch a positive feedback cycle appears to operate \\nduring parturition. The cycles continue to intensify the \\nstrength of contractions until delivery finally occurs.\\nLACTATION (p. 1066)\\nHigh Levels of Estrogen and Progesterone During the Later \\nMonths of Pregnancy Promote the Final Developmental \\nChanges in the Breasts That Prepare Them for Lactation. \\nEstrogen and progesterone do not stimulate milk \\nproduction by the alveolar cells. Milk formation \\nis achieved through the effects of prolactin, an \\nanterior pituitary hormone that is secreted in rising \\nconcentrations throughout pregnancy. The stimulatory \\neffect of prolactin is blocked by the high concentrations \\nof estrogen and progesterone secreted by the placenta, \\nso no milk is formed until after delivery of the baby. \\nWhen the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall, the \\nstimulatory effect of prolactin causes the cells of the \\nalveoli to synthesize milk, which accumulates in the \\nalveoli and ducts of the breast.\\nThe Mechanical Stimulation Associated With Suckling \\nElicits a Reflex to the Hypothalamus, Releasing Oxytocin \\nFrom the Posterior Pituitary Gland. Oxytocin travels to \\nthe breast in the blood and causes contraction of the \\nmyoepithelial cells that surround the ducts of the breast. \\nThe contraction increases the pressure of the milk filling \\nthe ducts, causing milk to flow from the nipple to the \\nbaby. Milk is not usually ejected from the breast until \\nthe baby suckles the nipple.\\nAfter delivery, prolactin levels tend to fall toward \\nnonpregnant levels. Stimulation of the nipples associ -\\nated with suckling, however, increases the release of \\nprolactin, which in turn stimulates milk production. \\nThe greater the duration of suckling, the greater is the \\nresponse of prolactin and the greater is the amount of \\nmilk produced by the breast.\\nThis feedback control system regulated by the baby’s \\ndesire for milk and duration of suckling provides for \\na well-regulated supply of milk for the baby from the \\ntime it is born until as long as 1 year or more after birth. \\nWhen the baby discontinues breastfeeding, the sig-\\nnal for prolactin secretion stops, and milk production \\ndeclines rapidly.'),\n",

The organization of the central \\nnervous system is completed during the first months \\nof gestation, but full development and even complete \\nmyelination do not take place until after delivery.\\nGastrointestinal Tract. By midpregnancy, the fetus \\ningests amniotic fluid and excretes meconium from the \\ngastrointestinal tract.

The surface tension \\nof the fluid-filled lungs at birth keeps the alveoli in a \\ncollapsed state. Approximately 25 mm Hg of negative \\ninspiratory pressure is required to overcome the surface \\ntension.

Because of the relatively small \\nresidual capacity (less than one half the volume per \\nkilogram of body weight than that of adults) and \\nrelatively high metabolic rate of the newborn, along with \\nimmaturity of the neural components of the respiratory \\ncontrol system, blood gas values fluctuate widely during \\nthe first weeks of life.\\nCirculation. Blood volume at birth is normally \\nabout 300 milliliters. If the baby is left attached to the \\nplacenta for a few minutes after birth, approximately \\n75 milliliters of additional blood can enter the baby’s \\ncirculatory system, which is equivalent to a transfusion \\nof 25 percent of the blood volume. This overload could \\ncontribute to an elevation of left atrial pressure and a \\ntendency to develop pulmonary edema.\\nLiver Function. Bilirubin formed from the breakdown \\nof hemoglobin from red blood cells is normally \\nexcreted by the liver into the bile after being conjugated \\nwith glucuronic acid; however, the neonatal liver \\nhas inadequate ability to conjugate bilirubin at the \\nrate it is formed. As a result, the blood concentration \\nof bilirubin rises for the first 3 days after birth and \\nthen returns to normal as the capability of the liver \\nincreases. This condition is referred to as physiological \\nhyperbilirubinemia and can be seen in some cases as a \\nslight jaundice or yellowish tint in the skin and sclera \\nof the eyes.\\nIn addition to the potential problems associated with \\nbilirubin conjugation, the limited capability of the liver \\nduring the first few days of life can lead to difficulty syn -\\nthesizing adequate quantities of protein for maintaining \\ncolloid osmotic pressure, adequate amounts of glucose, \\nand necessary amounts of the factors required for coag-\\nulation.

These and other factors can \\ncontribute to problems in the newborn regarding the \\nregulation of fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, \\npH, and colloid osmotic pressure.\\nDigestion and Metabolism. The gastrointestinal \\nabsorptive capacity and hepatic digestive function of \\nneonates are limited to some extent in the following \\nways:\\n •  Absorption of starches is limited by a deficient rate of \\nsecretion of pancreatic amylase, which breaks down \\ncomplex carbohydrates such as starches.\\n •  Absorption of fat is not as great in neonates as it is in \\nolder children.\\n •  Gluconeogenic capacity of the liver is not sufficient \\nin many newborns to maintain the blood glucose \\nconcentration in the normal range for long periods \\nafter feeding. It is therefore important to maintain \\nthe newborn on a schedule of frequent feedings.\\nAll of these gastrointestinal limitations are exac -\\nerbated in preterm infants. The limited capacities for \\nabsorption of starches and fats are worsened by feed -\\ning cow’s milk–based formulas to preterm and newborn \\ninfants. The carbohydrates and fats in human milk are \\ndigested and absorbed more readily than those in non-\\nhuman milk and formula preparations.\\nThe basal metabolic rate of the newborn is twice as \\nhigh per kilogram of body weight as that of an adult, and \\nthe surface area to body rate ratio is much greater in the \\nneonate than in the adult. As a result, body tempera -\\nture control is relatively unstable, especially in preterm \\ninfants.'),\n",

The velocity achieved in a 100-meter \\ndash, however, is only about 1.75 times as great as that \\nachieved in a 10,000-meter run.\\nEndurance Depends on Maintaining a Nutrition Supply \\nfor the Muscle . As seen in Table 85–2, a person who \\nconsumes a high-carbohydrate diet stores more glycogen \\nin the muscles, which increases endurance in races at \\nmarathon speeds. Marathon runners often eat a large \\namount of carbohydrates, such as pasta, on the day \\nbefore the race.\\nMuscle Metabolic Systems During Exercise  \\n(p. 1086)\\nThe basic sources of energy for muscle contraction are: \\n •  Phosphagen system, which consists of adenosine tri -\\nphosphate (ATP) and phosphocreatine\\n •  Glycogen–lactic acid system\\n •  Aerobic system\\nTable 85–2  Effects of Glycogen Storage on Exercise \\nEndurance\\nDiet\\nGlycogen Stored in \\nMuscle  \\n(g/kg of Muscle)\\nEndurance Time at \\nMarathon  \\nSpeed (min)\\nHigh carbohydrate 40 240\\nMixed 20 120\\nHigh fat 6 85\\nTable 85–1  Muscle Power During Exercise\\nTime Muscle Power (kg-m/min)\\nFirst 8-10 seconds 7000\\nNext 1 minute 4000\\nNext 30 minutes 1700'),\n",

ATP is converted \\nto adenosine diphosphate (ADP) by the removal of \\none high-energy phosphate radical; this releases 7300 \\ncalories per mole of ATP . This energy is used for muscle \\ncontraction as ATP combines with the myosin filaments. \\nThe removal of another phosphate radical converts ADP \\nto adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and supplies an \\nadditional 7300 calories per mole of ADP .\\nThe amount of ATP present in muscle sustains \\nmaximal muscle contraction for only 3 seconds, but \\nthe phosphocreatine system also supplies energy. The \\ncombination of the cellular ATP and phosphocreatine \\nsystem is called the phosphagen energy system.\\nPhosphocreatine (or creatine phosphate) is the com-\\nbination of creatine and a phosphate radical connected \\nwith a high-energy phosphate bond, which, when bro-\\nken, provides 10,300 calories per mole. Adding to the \\nimportance of this system is the fact that muscle cells \\nhave twofold to fourfold more phosphocreatine than \\nAT P.\\nPhosphocreatine reversibly combines with ADP \\nto form ATP and creatine in the cell. This phospha -\\ngen energy system by itself, however, supplies only \\nenough energy for 8 to 10 seconds of maximal muscle \\ncontraction, or nearly enough energy for a 100-meter \\nrace.\\nThe Glycogen–Lactic Acid System Supplies Energy \\nThrough Anaerobic Metabolism . The glycogen stored \\nin muscle rapidly splits into glucose molecules \\nthat can be used for energy. The initial stage of this \\nprocess is called glycolysis; it occurs without the use \\nof oxygen and is referred to as anaerobic metabolism.  \\nThe glycogen in this process is mostly converted to \\nlactic acid and supplies four ATP molecules for each \\nmolecule of glucose. An advantage of this glycogen–\\nlactic acid system is that it forms ATP 2.5 times as \\nfast as oxidative metabolism in the mitochondria. The \\nsystem supplies enough energy for maximal muscle \\ncontraction for 1.3 to 1.6 minutes.\\nFor longer periods of muscle use, energy for muscle \\ncontraction must be supplied through the aerobic sys -\\ntem. In this system, glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids \\nare oxidized in the mitochondria to form ATP .\\nRecovery of Energy Systems After Exercise Requires \\nOxygen. After exercise is completed, the energy sources \\nof muscle must be reconstituted. Any lactic acid formed '),\n",

The extra liver glucose forms \\nglycogen, which replenishes the glycogen stores in \\nmuscles.\\nThe aerobic system is also replenished after exercise \\nby two means:\\n •  The increased respiration that occurs after exercise \\nreplenishes the oxygen debt. The oxygen debt is the \\ndeficit in the oxygen stored in the body as air in the \\nlungs, dissolved in body fluids, and combined with \\nhemoglobin and myoglobin.\\n •  The glycogen is replaced in the muscle.  This process \\ncan take days to complete after extreme long-lasting \\nexercise, with the recovery time highly dependent \\non the diet of the person. A person who consumes a \\nhigh-carbohydrate diet replenishes muscle glycogen \\nstores much faster than a person who consumes \\neither a mixed diet or a high-fat diet.\\nResistive Training Significantly Enhances \\nMuscle Strength (p. 1089)\\nIf the muscles are exercised under no load, even for \\nhours, little increase in strength occurs. However, mus -\\ncles that contract with at least a 50 percent maximum \\nforce for a few times each day three times a week will \\ndevelop strength rapidly, and muscle mass will increase. \\nExperiments have shown that six nearly maximal mus -\\ncle contractions performed in three sets each day, 3 days \\na week, give nearly optimal increase in muscle strength \\nwithout producing chronic muscle fatigue. Most of the \\nhypertrophy is caused by an increase in the size of the \\nmuscle fibers, but the number of fibers increases mod-\\nerately. Other changes occur in the muscle during train -\\ning, including the following:\\n •  Inc rease in number of myofibrils\\n •  U p to 120 percent increase in mitochondrial en -\\nzymes\\n •  A 60 t o 80 percent increase in the components of the \\nphosphagen energy system\\n •  A 50 p ercent increase in stored glycogen\\n •  A 75 t o 100 percent increase in stored triglycerides\\nFast-Twitch and Slow-Twitch Muscle Fibers and \\nVarious Types of Exercise (p. 1090)\\nFast-twitch muscle fibers give a person the ability to \\ncontract muscles rapidly and forcefully.

In contrast, \\nslow-twitch fibers are used for endurance exercises, \\nsuch as marathons.\\nRESPIRATION DURING EXERCISE (p. 1090)\\nMaximum Oxygen Consumption Increases During Athletic \\nTraining. The maximum oxygen consumption (V o2) of \\nthe average untrained male is 3600 ml/min; this rate \\nincreases to 4000 ml/min in the athletically trained male \\nand to 5100 ml/min in the male marathon runner. The \\nmaximum Vo2 increases during training, but the high \\nvalues in marathon runners may be partly genetically \\ndetermined by factors such as large lung capacity \\nin relation to body size and strength of respiratory \\nmuscles.\\nAt maximal exercise, pulmonary ventilation is 100 \\nto 110 L/min, but maximum breathing capacity exceeds \\nthis by 50 percent. The lungs have a built-in safety \\nmechanism that can be helpful if exercise is attempted \\n(1) at a high altitude, (2) under hot conditions, or (3) \\nwith some abnormality in the respiratory system.\\nPulmonary Oxygen-Diffusing Capacity Increases in \\nAthletes. The oxygen-diffusing capacity is the rate at \\nwhich oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the blood per \\nmm Hg oxygen pressure. During exercise, the diffusing \\ncapacity increases in a nonathlete from a resting value of \\n23 ml/min/mm Hg to 48 ml/min/mm Hg. The diffusing \\ncapacity increases during exercise mainly because of the \\nopening of underperfused pulmonary capillaries, which \\nprovides more surface area for diffusion of oxygen.'),\n",

Most of the muscle blood flow occurs between \\ncontractions because the blood vessels are compressed \\nduring the contractile process. An increase in arterial \\npressure during exercise directly increases flow. Stretch-\\ning of the arteriolar walls by the increase in pressure \\ndecreases vascular resistance and increases flow much \\nmore.\\nAthletic Training Increases Stroke Volume and \\nDecreases Resting Heart Rate. If a person starts extensive \\nathletic training of the aerobic type, both the heart size \\nand maximum cardiac output usually increase. The \\nstroke volume thus increases, and the resting heart rate \\ndecreases. Table 85–3 shows the results of training. \\nNote that the stroke volume increases only 50 percent \\nduring maximum exercise in the marathoner, and the \\nheart rate increases 270 percent. Cardiac output can \\nbe calculated from the data in Table 85–3 with the \\nfollowing formula:\\nCardiac output= Stroke volume× Heart rate\\nThe increase in heart rate provides a much greater \\nproportion of the increase in cardiac output in the mar-\\nathoner than does the increase in stroke volume.\\nThe Heart Limits the Amount of Exercise One Can \\nPerform. During maximum exercise, cardiac output is \\nat 90 percent of its maximum value, but pulmonary \\nventilation is only 65 percent of its maximum. The \\ncardiovascular system usually limits the amount of \\nexercise that can be performed.\\nTable 85–3   Comparison of Cardiac Output Between \\nMarathoners and Nonathletes\\nCondition Stroke Volume (ml)\\nHeart Rate  \\n(beats/min)\\nResting\\nNonathlete 75 75\\nMarathoner 105 50\\nMaximum\\nNonathlete 110 195\\nMarathoner 162 185'),\n",
